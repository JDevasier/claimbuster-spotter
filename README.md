# Claim Spotting
In this repository we are providing code to train claim-spotting models via:
  - [SVM](https://github.com/idirlab/claimspotter/tree/master/svm)
  - [Bi-Directional LSTM](https://github.com/idirlab/claimspotter/tree/master/bidirectional-lstm)
  - [Adversarial Training on a Transformer Model](https://github.com/idirlab/claimspotter/tree/master/bert-adversarial)

### SVM and BiLSTM Code
We have also hosted the SVM and BiLSTM code in Colab's. The transformer code is more complex, so we do not have a Colab setup for that.
