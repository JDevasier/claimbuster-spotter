1	0	"Good evening, and welcome to the MSNBC Democratic candidates debate."
2	0	We are super excited to be here at the University of New Hampshire.
3	0	"Tonight, this is the first time that Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have squared off exactly like this."
4	0	"Face-to-face, just one-on-one, just the two of them."
5	0	And neither party has seen this yet.
6	0	"These candidates are both running for the Democratic nomination, but they are very different from each other when it comes to what matters most and how they would go about the job of being president."
7	0	"Our job tonight is to draw out those differences so you, the voters, can understand them and be fully informed."
8	0	And we do hope that the candidates will take this opportunity to show us the distinctions -- show us the differences between them.
9	0	That's the whole reason that we're here tonight.
10	0	We're not here for talking points.
11	0	We're to learn about the difference between the candidates.
12	0	"And with that, let's get going."
13	0	Please join us in welcoming Secretary Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders.
14	0	(APPLAUSE)
15	0	"First, I want to say a special thanks to the New Hampshire union leader for helping make this debate possible, and the readers, who helped provide some of the questions and topics that we'll be addressing tonight."
16	0	"The rules tonight, by the way, are simple"
17	0	"90 seconds for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals."
18	0	"And with that, that's it."
19	0	We're going to begin with 60- second opening statements from each of the candidates.
20	0	"And as agreed to in advance by the two campaigns, we're going to begin tonight with Senator Sanders."
21	0	"Rachel, thank you very much."
22	0	Millions of Americans are giving up on the political process.
23	0	And they're giving up on the political process because they understand the economy is rigged.
24	1	They are working longer hours for low wages.
25	1	"They're worried about the future of their kids, and yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent."
26	0	Not what America is supposed to be about.
27	0	Not the fairness that we grew up believing that America was about.
28	0	"And then sustaining that rigged economy is a corrupt campaign finance system undermining American democracy, where billionaire, Wall Street, corporate America can contribute unlimited sums of money into super PACs and into candidates."
29	0	"Our job, together, is to end a rigged economy, create an economy that works for all, and absolutely overturn Citizens United."
30	0	"One person, one vote."
31	0	That's what American democracy is about.
32	0	"Thank you, Senator."
33	0	Secretary Clinton.
34	0	"Well, I'm happy to be here in New Hampshire for this debate, as we move toward the primary on Tuesday."
35	0	"I believe that America has the opportunity to once again live by our values, live up to our values in the 21st century, but I think that America can only do that if Americans can succeed."
36	0	And there are lots of reasons why Americans today are feeling left out and left behind.
37	0	"Yes, of course, the economy has not been working for most Americans."
38	0	"Yes, of course, we have special interests that are unfortunately doing too much to rig the game."
39	0	"But there's also the continuing challenges of racism, of sexism, of discrimination against the LGBT community, of the way that we treat people as opposed to how we want to be treated."
40	0	I believe that we can get back on the right track.
41	0	"I want to imagine a country where people's wages reflect their hard work, where we have healthcare for everyone, and where every child gets to live up to his or her potential."
42	0	"I'm fighting for people who cannot wait for those changes, and I'm not making promises that I cannot keep."
43	0	All right.
44	0	Let's get started.
45	0	"Secretary Clinton, last night you cited the Concord Monitor when you said of Senator Sanders that, quote, ""It's very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable."""
46	0	"So please tell us why you think if he's elected president on a platform of promising things like free public college and universal healthcare, that he cannot achieve those things."
47	0	"Well, let me start by saying that Senator Sanders and I share some very big progressive goals."
48	0	"I've been fighting for universal healthcare for many years, and we're now on the path to achieving it."
49	0	I don't want us to start over again.
50	0	"I think that would be a great mistake, to once again plunge our country into a contentious debate about whether we should have and what kind of system we should have for healthcare."
51	0	I want to build on the progress we've made; got from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent coverage.
52	0	And I don't want to rip away the security that people finally have; 18 million people now have healthcare; preexisting conditions are no longer a bar.
53	0	So we have a difference.
54	0	"I also believe in affordable college, but I don't believe in free college, because every expert that I have talked to says, look, how will you ever control the costs."
55	0	"What I want to do is make sure middle class kids, not Donald Trump's kids, get to be able to afford college."
56	0	I want to get the economy going again.
57	0	"It's not just enough about what we're against, as important as that is."
58	0	"I have a plan to create new jobs, manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy jobs that will make us the 21st century clean energy super power."
59	0	I also want to make sure small businesses can start and grow again.
60	0	"And of course, I believe in raising the minimum wage and equal pay for work."
61	0	"But the numbers just don't add up, from what Senator Sanders has been proposing."
62	0	"That's why all of the independent experts, all of the editorial boards that have vetted both of us have concluded that it is just not achievable."
63	0	Let's go down a path where we can actually tell people what we will do.
64	0	A progressive is someone who makes progress.
65	0	That's what I intend to do.
66	0	"Thank you, Secretary."
67	0	"Senator Sanders, so just explain how you spent nearly two decades in Congress and haven't gotten any of these things passed."
68	0	"Why do you think as president you'll be able to achieve big, big new programs like this?"
69	0	"Well, I haven't quite run for president before."
70	0	(LAUGHTER)
71	0	(APPLAUSE)
72	0	Let's deal with some of the comments that Secretary Clinton made.
73	0	"And by the way, you know, sometimes there's a lot of drama here."
74	0	I have known Secretary Clinton for 25 years and respect her very much.
75	0	Here is the issue.
76	0	"Every major country on earth, whether it's the U.K., whether it's France, whether it's Canada, has managed to provide healthcare to all people as a right and they are spending significantly less per capita on health care than we are."
77	0	So I do not accept the belief that the United States of America can't do that.
78	0	I do not accept the belief that the United States of America and our government can't stand up to the ripoffs of the pharmaceutical industry which charge us by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
79	0	"Number two, in the economy today, everybody understands that we need a well educated workforce."
80	0	This is 2016.
81	0	"When we talk about public education, it can no longer be K through 12th grade."
82	0	I do believe that public colleges and universities should be tuition free.
83	0	"Well, how do we pay for that?"
84	0	It's an expensive proposition.
85	0	"I do believe that we should substantially lower student debt in this country, which is crushing millions of people."
86	0	"We pay for it, in my view, by a tax on Wall Street speculation."
87	0	The middle class bailed out Wall Street in their time of need.
88	0	"Now, it is Wall Street's time to help the middle class."
89	0	(APPLAUSE)
90	0	If I could just follow up on that.
91	0	(APPLAUSE)
92	0	"There is no disagreement between us on universal coverage for health care, the disagreement is where do we start from and where do we end up."
93	0	"The Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I want to improve it."
94	0	"I want to build on it, get the costs down, get prescription drug costs down."
95	0	Senator Sanders wants us to start all over again.
96	0	"This was a major achievement of President Obama, of our country."
97	0	It is helping people right now.
98	0	I am not going to wait and have us plunge back into a contentious national debate that has very little chance of succeeding.
99	0	Let's make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody.
100	0	(APPLAUSE)
101	0	Let me...
102	0	Go.
103	0	... this is a good discussion here.
104	0	"Yes, go ahead."
105	0	And let me just say this.
106	0	"As Secretary Clinton may know, I am on the Health Education Labor Committee."
107	0	That committee wrote the Affordable Care Act.
108	0	The idea I would dismantle health care in America while we're waiting to pass a Medicare for all is just not accurate.
109	0	"The Affordable Care Act has clearly, as Secretary Clinton made the point, done a lot of good things, but, what it has not done is dealt with the fact we have 29 million people today who have zero health insurance, we have even more who are underinsured with large deductibles and copayments and prescription drug prices are off the wall."
110	0	"So I do believe that in the future, not by dismantling what we have here -- I helped write that bill -- but by moving forward, rallying the American people, I do believe we should have health care for all."
111	0	(APPLAUSE)
112	0	"All right, thank you both."
113	0	Rachel.
114	0	"Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders is campaigning against you now, at this point in the campaign, basically arguing that you are not progressive enough to be the Democratic nominee."
115	0	"He has said that if you voted for the Iraq war, if you are in favor of the death penalty, if you wobbled on things like the Keystone Pipeline or TPP, if you said single payer health care could never happen, then you're too far to the right of the Democratic Party to be the party's standard bearer."
116	0	"Given those policy positions, why should liberal Democrats support you and not Senator Sanders?"
117	0	Well because I am a progressive who gets things done.
118	0	"And the root of that word, progressive, is progress."
119	0	"But I've heard Senator Sanders comments, and it's really caused me to wonder who's left in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party."
120	0	"Under his definition, President Obama is not progressive because he took donations from Wall Street; Vice President Biden is not progressive because she supported Keystone; Senator Shaheen is not progressive because she supports the trade pact."
121	0	"Even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone would not fit this definition because he voted for DOMA."
122	0	"You know, we have differences and, honestly, I think we should be talk about what we want to do for the country."
123	0	"But if we're going to get into labels, I don't think it was particularly progressive to vote against the Brady Bill five times."
124	0	(APPLAUSE)
125	0	I don't think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity.
126	0	I don't think it was progressive to vote against Ted Kennedy's immigration reform.
127	0	"So we could go back and forth like this, but the fact is most people watching tonight want to know what we've done and what we will do."
128	0	"That's why I am laying out a specific agenda that will make more progress, get more jobs with rising incomes, get us to universal health care coverage, get us to universal pre-k, paid family leave and the other elements of what I think will build a strong economy, that will ensure Americans keep making progress."
129	0	That's what I'm offering and that's what I will do as president.
130	0	(APPLAUSE)
131	0	"Senator Sanders, have you established a list of what it means to be a progressive that is unrealistic?"
132	0	"No, not at all."
133	0	Here's the reality of American economic life today.
134	0	The reality is that we have one of lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth because so many people have given up on the political process.
135	1	The reality is that there has been trillions of dollars of wealth going from the middle class in the last 30 years to the top 1/10th of 1 percent.
136	0	The reality is we that have a corrupt campaign finance system which separates the American people's needs and desires from what Congress is doing.
137	0	"So to my mind, what we have got to do is wage a political revolution where millions of people have given up on the political process, stand up and fight back, demand the government that represents us and not just a handful of campaign contribution -- contributors."
138	0	"Now all of the ideas that I'm talking about, they are not radical ideas."
139	0	"Making public colleges and universities tuition free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States."
140	0	"Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and creating 13 million jobs by doing away with tax loopholes that large corporations now enjoy by putting their money into the Cayman Islands and other tax havens."
141	0	That is not a radical idea.
142	0	"What we need to do is to stand up to the big money interests, and the campaign contributors."
143	0	"When we do that, we can, in fact, transform America."
144	0	Thank you Senator.
145	0	(APPLAUSE)
146	0	"I'd like to follow up on a comment that Secretary Clinton said, Senator."
147	0	President Obama has not called for abolishing the death penalty.
148	0	"President Obama is for the big Asian trade deal known as TPP, and just yesterday you said you can't be both a moderate or a progressive, but you can't be both."
149	0	"Is President Obama, in your judgment, based on these policies positions, a progressive?"
150	0	Let me just pick up on this point.
151	0	"This whole discussion began because I commented, not making overall evaluation about the Secretary."
152	0	"She was in Ohio, I think, in September or November and she got up and said something like, I have been -- I'm paraphrasing, I have been criticized because people think I'm a moderate."
153	0	"Well, I am a moderate."
154	0	That's where this came from.
155	0	It wasn't me paraphrasing her.
156	0	"It is what she said, and all that I said was there's nothing wrong with being a moderate."
157	0	"But, you can't be a moderate, you can't a progressive."
158	0	"In terms of President Obama, I think if we remember where this country was seven years ago, 800,000 jobs being lost every month, $1.4 trillion dollar deficit."
159	0	The world's financial system on the verge of collapse.
160	0	"I think that President Obama, Vice President Biden, and the Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate have done a fantastic job."
161	0	"We are in much better shape than we were seven years ago, although my Republican colleagues seem to have forgotten where we were seven years ago."
162	0	"That's the fact, but, we still have a very long way to go."
163	0	Do I think President Obama is a progressive?
164	0	"Yes, I do."
165	0	I disagree with him on a number of issues including the trade agreement.
166	0	"But, yes, I think he has done an excellent job."
167	0	"Well, Chuck..."
168	0	"... (inaudible) Clinton, go ahead..."
169	0	"If I could, you know, in the very first debate I was asked am I a moderate or a progressive and I said I'm a progressive who likes to get things done."
170	0	"Cherry picking a quote here or there doesn't change my record of having fought for racial justice, having fought for kids rights, having fought the kind of inequities that fueled my interest in service in the first place going back to my days in the Children's Defense Fund."
171	0	It certainly didn't stop me from taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies.
172	0	"Before it was called Hillarycare -- I mean, before it was called ObamaCare it was called Hillarycare because we took them on, and we weren't successful, but we kept fighting and we got the children's health insurance program."
173	0	"Every step along the way I have stood up, and fought, and have the scars to prove it."
174	0	"So, again..."
175	0	(APPLAUSE)
176	0	"I think it's important that, look, I understand Senator Sanders really trying to distinguish himself."
177	0	"I understand that, that's what you do in campaigns, but at the same time let's not be -- in, I think an unfair way, making an accusation, or making an attack about where I stand and about where I've always stood."
178	0	"It is fair to say, Senator, that in your definition, as you being the self-proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism, I don't know anyone else who fits that definition, but I know a lot of really hard fighting progressives in the Democratic party who have stood up time, and time again against special interests, against the powerful on behalf of those who are left behind and left out."
179	0	"And, that's what we ought to be celebrating."
180	0	"Let's talk about what we would do as President, and Commander in Chief to make sure the progress continues into the future."
181	0	(APPLAUSE)
182	0	"(inaudible) 30 seconds, and then we'll move."
183	0	"That's right, I mean, instead of arguing about definitions, let's talk about..."
184	0	"... Well, you began it yesterday with your comments..."
185	0	"... What we should do, and one of the things we should do is not only talk the talk, but walk the walk."
186	0	"I am very proud to be the only candidate up here who does not have a Super PAC, who's not raising huge sums of money from Wall Street..."
187	0	(APPLAUSE)
188	0	... And special interests.
189	0	I am enormously proud.
190	0	"Never believed it would happen that we have raised 3.5 million individual contributions, averaging $27 dollars a piece."
191	0	That is what the political revolution means.
192	0	(APPLAUSE)
193	0	Thank you.
194	0	"Senator Sanders, as a Vermonter, you have almost a home state advantage here in New Hampshire."
195	0	"But back home across the border, you also have a long history of running against Democrats as a third-party candidate, for governor, Senate, for Congress."
196	0	In 1988 your candidacy as a third-party candidate arguably cost the Democrats a congressional seat and sent a Republican instead.
197	0	How can you lead the Democratic Party nationally when you have not been a member of the Democratic Party until very recently?
198	0	"Well, Rachel, actually, that wasn't accurate."
199	0	"In 1988 the Republican did win, I believe, by 3 points."
200	0	I came in second.
201	0	"It was 34-31, I think, 19 for the Democrat."
202	0	"In that race the Democrat was the spoiler, not me."
203	0	And it is true...
204	0	(LAUGHTER)
205	0	(APPLAUSE)
206	0	"It is true, it's not to be denied, I am the longest- serving independent in the history of the United States Congress."
207	0	People of Vermont sent me to Washington as an independent.
208	0	That is true.
209	0	"But on the other hand, I have -- when I was in the House for 16 years, I caucused with the Democrats."
210	0	"In the Senate for nine years caucused with the Democrats, of course."
211	0	"And I was elected by the Democrats to be chair of the Veterans Committee three years ago, which I'm very proud of."
212	0	"And now am the rankings member on the Budget Committee, leader of the Democrats in opposition to the majority Republicans."
213	0	I am running for president as a Democrat.
214	0	"And if elected, not only do I hope to bring forth a major change in national priorities, but let me be frank, I do want to see major changes in the Democratic Party."
215	0	I want to see working people and young people come into the party in a way that doesn't exist now.
216	0	"And you know what, I want a 50-state strategy so the Democratic Party is not just the party of 25 states."
217	0	(APPLAUSE)
218	0	Secretary Clinton.
219	0	"You know, the person who first put out the idea of a 50-state party strategy is former Governor Howard Dean, who is with us tonight."
220	0	(APPLAUSE)
221	0	And I'm very proud and grateful to have the support of so many elected Vermonters and former officials.
222	0	"Two former governors, the current governor, the current other senator."
223	0	I really appreciate that.
224	0	"And I think it's because they've worked with me, they've seen what I do."
225	0	They know what kind of a colleague I am.
226	0	They want me as their partner in the White House.
227	0	And that's exactly what I will do.
228	0	We'll get things done together.
229	0	"Democrats, Republicans, independents, we're going to make progress together when I'm president."
230	0	(APPLAUSE)
231	0	"So, Senator, to that point, Secretary Clinton is raising the issue of endorsements by your home state Democrats."
232	0	She's implying that that says something about the people who know you best.
233	0	"Well, I don't see it quite like that."
234	0	How do you see it?
235	0	"I am -- will absolutely admit that Secretary Clinton has the support of far more governors, mayors, members of the House."
236	0	She has the entire establishment or almost the entire establishment behind her.
237	0	That's a fact.
238	0	I don't deny it.
239	0	But I am pretty proud that we have over a million people who have contributed to our campaign averaging 27 bucks apiece.
240	0	"That we have had meetings where 25,000-30,000 people have come out."
241	0	"That our campaign is a campaign of the people, by the people, and for the people."
242	0	"So, Rachel, yes, Secretary Clinton does represent the establishment."
243	0	"I represent, I hope, ordinary Americans, and by the way, who are not all that enamored with the establishment, but I am very proud to have people like Keith Ellison and Raul Grijalva in the House, the co-chairmen of the House Progressive Caucus."
244	0	Secretary.
245	0	"Well, look, I've got to just jump in here because, honestly, Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president, as exemplifying the establishment."
246	0	And I've got to tell you that it is...
247	0	(APPLAUSE)
248	0	It is really quite amusing to me.
249	0	People support me because they know me.
250	0	They know my life's work.
251	0	They have worked with me and many have also worked with Senator Sanders.
252	0	And at the end of the day they endorse me because they know I can get things done.
253	0	(APPLAUSE)
254	0	I am not going to make promises I can't keep.
255	0	I am not going to talk about big ideas like single-payer and then not level with people about how much it will cost.
256	0	A respected health economist said that these plans would cost a trillion dollars more a year.
257	0	"I'm not going to tell people that I will raise your incomes and not your taxes, and not mean it, because I don't want to see the kind of struggle that the middle class is going through exemplified by these promises that would raise taxes and make it much more difficult for many, many Americans to get ahead and stay ahead."
258	0	That is not my agenda.
259	0	(APPLAUSE)
260	0	"Senator Sanders, you'll have 30 seconds to respond to that."
261	0	"What being part of the establishment is, is, in the last quarter, having a super PAC that raised $15 million from Wall Street, that throughout one's life raised a whole lot of money from the drug companies and other special interests."
262	0	"To my mind, if we do not get a handle on money in politics and the degree to which big money controls the political process in this country, nobody is going to bring about the changes that is needed in this country for the middle class and working families."
263	0	"Yeah, but I -- I think it's fair to really ask what's behind that comment."
264	0	"You know, Senator Sanders has said he wants to run a positive campaign."
265	0	"I've tried to keep my disagreements over issues, as it should be."
266	0	"But time and time again, by innuendo, by insinuation, there is this attack that he is putting forth, which really comes down to -- you know, anybody who ever took donations or speaking fees from any interest group has to be bought."
267	0	"And I just absolutely reject that, Senator."
268	0	And I really don't think these kinds of attacks by insinuation are worthy of you.
269	0	And enough is enough.
270	0	"If you've got something to say, say it directly."
271	0	But you will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received.
272	0	What...
273	0	(APPLAUSE)
274	0	"And I have stood up and I have represented my constituents to the best of my abilities, and I'm very proud of that."
275	0	... you know...
276	0	So I think it's time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out...
277	0	(inaudible).
278	0	(APPLAUSE)
279	0	"... in recent weeks, and let's talk..."
280	0	(BOOING)
281	0	... let's talk about about the issues.
282	0	Let's talk about the issues that divide us.
283	0	"Let's talk about -- OK, let's talk..."
284	0	And let's -- let's...
285	0	... let us talk about issues.
286	0	... we both agree with campaign finance reform.
287	0	Let's talk about issues.
288	0	I -- I worked hard for McCain-Feingold.
289	0	Let's...
290	0	I want to reverse Citizens United.
291	0	... let's -- let's -- let's talk about issues.
292	0	And so -- let's talk about issues.
293	0	"Let's talk -- let's talk about issues, all right?"
294	0	"Let's talk about why, in the 1990s, Wall Street got deregulated."
295	0	Did it have anything to do with the fact that Wall Street provided -- spent billions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions?
296	0	"Well, some people might think, yeah, that had some influence."
297	0	(LAUGHTER)
298	0	"Let's ask why it is that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, and your medicine can be doubled tomorrow, and there's nothing that the government can do to stop it."
299	0	You think it has anything to do with the huge amounts of campaign contributions and lobbying from the fossil fuel industry?
300	0	Let's talk about climate change.
301	1	"Do you think there's a reason why not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real, and that we need to transform our energy system?"
302	0	Do you think it has anything to do with the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil pouring huge amounts of money into the political system?
303	0	That is what goes on in America.
304	0	I am not -- I like...
305	0	(APPLAUSE)
306	0	... there is a reason.
307	0	"You know, there is a reason why these people are putting huge amounts of money into our political system."
308	0	"And in my view, it is undermining American democracy and it is allowing Congress to represent wealthy campaign contributors and not the working families of this country."
309	0	"Well, you know, Senator, I don't think -- I don't..."
310	0	(CROSSTALK)
311	0	(APPLAUSE)
312	0	"... Secretary, we're gonna..."
313	0	"I don't think you could find any person in political life today who has been subjected to more attacks and had more money spent against her by special interests, among whom you have named a few, than I."
314	0	And I'm proud of that.
315	0	"You know, when I took on the drug companies and the insurance companies for universal health care coverage, they went after me with a vengeance."
316	0	"Today, you've got hedge fund billionaires aligned with Karl Rove, running ads against me to try to get Democrats to vote for you."
317	0	I know this game.
318	0	I'm going to stop this game.
319	0	"But while we're talking about votes, you're the one who voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives in 2000, which contributed to the over-leveraging of Lehman Brothers, which was one of the culprits that brought down the economy."
320	0	So I don't know -- I'm not impugning your motive because you voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives.
321	0	People make mistakes and I'm certainly not saying you did it for any kind of financial advantage.
322	0	What we've got to do as Democrats -- what we've got to do as Democrats is to be united to actually solve these problems.
323	0	And what I believe is that I have a better track record and a better opportunity to actually get that job done.
324	0	That's what this election should be about.
325	0	(APPLAUSE)
326	0	Thirty seconds.
327	0	(CROSSTALK)
328	0	(APPLAUSE)
329	0	"I think as Secretary Clinton knows, there is nobody who fought harder."
330	0	I was on the House Financial Committee at that time.
331	0	"I heard the arguments coming from Democrats and Republicans -- Robert Rubin, Alan Greenspan -- about great an idea it would be if we did away with Glass-Steagall and if we allowed investor banks and commercial banks and big insurance companies to merge."
332	0	Go to YouTube today.
333	0	Look up Greenspan-Sanders.
334	0	Listen to what I told them then.
335	0	I helped lead the effort against deregulation.
336	0	"Unfortunately, we lost that."
337	0	The result is -- was the worst financial disaster since the Great Depression.
338	0	Thank you both.
339	0	"Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton, obviously we've touched a nerve."
340	0	"We're going to be back with more on this subject, and much more, right after this."
341	0	Stay with us.
342	0	(APPLAUSE)
343	0	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
344	0	(APPLAUSE)
345	0	"All right, welcome back."
346	0	Let's get right to it.
347	0	"Senator Sanders, you were talking about all of your campaign contributions and campaign finance reform."
348	0	You rail against big money in politics.
349	0	"But do you realize there is one public financing system that we do have in place, and it is -- it is in place to run for president."
350	0	Why aren't you walking the walk on that?
351	0	Why aren't you participating in the presidential public financing system which is designed to essentially keep big money out of presidential politics?
352	0	"Chuck, actually we looked at it, but it turns out to be a disaster."
353	0	"The way it is structured right now, if you make it all the way to California, you could do pretty well."
354	0	"But in terms of the early states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, the other states -- it just doesn't work."
355	0	Your point is well taken.
356	0	"I believe in public funding of elections, absolutely."
357	0	But this system is -- I don't know if the secretary would agree -- is currently very antiquated and no longer applies to modern day politics.
358	0	"Well, going on that then, why criticize her on Super PACs, and you got -- and all this when it is -- you know, that's the system?"
359	0	"I mean, you could be participating in a publicly-financing -- public financing system..."
360	0	But if the...
361	0	... and being able to set -- being able to set an example.
362	0	"-- but Chuck, it is a public financing system that everybody knows is antiquated."
363	0	It no longer works.
364	0	Nobody can become president based on that system.
365	0	So what's the alternative?
366	0	There are two alternatives.
367	0	"And, you know, we looked at it."
368	0	"Well, should we do a Super PAC, but I concluded, honestly, I don't represent Corporate America or billionaires, I didn't want it."
369	0	So the other alternative was to ask working families and the middle class to help out in a transformational campaign.
370	0	And you know what?
371	0	"We got 3.5 million individual contributions, $27 a piece."
372	0	I think that's pretty good.
373	0	(APPLAUSE)
374	0	"Secretary Clinton, on the issue of Wall Street..."
375	0	On the issue of Wall Street.
376	0	"... on the issue of Wall Street, when our reporters go out and talk to people on the ground in the early states, what they tell us over and over again when they find voters who are leaning toward Senator Sanders rather than yourself is that the most frequent area of concern that they hear from those voters is the issue of Wall Street and whether or not you are too close to Wall Street."
377	0	"Last night, when you were asked about speaking fees and the amount of speaking fees you got from Goldman Sachs speeches, you said that's what they offered."
378	0	Have you been too dismissive of voters' concerns about this issue in your own campaign and your own career?
379	0	"Well you know, Rachel, I think I may not have done the job I should in explaining my record."
380	0	"You know, I did -- when I left the secretary of State's office, like so many former officials, military leaders, journalists, others, I did go on the speaking circuit."
381	0	"I spoke to heart doctors, I spoke to the American Camping Association, I spoke to auto dealers, and yes, I spoke to firms on Wall Street."
382	0	"They wanted me to talk about the world, what my experience had been as secretary of State."
383	0	But what I want people to know is I went to Wall Street before the crash.
384	0	I was the one saying you're going to wreck the economy because of these shenanigans with mortgages.
385	0	I called to end the carried interest loophole that hedge fund managers enjoy.
386	0	I proposed changes in CEO compensation.
387	0	I called for a consumer protection financial bureau before it was created.
388	0	And I think the best evidence that the Wall Street people at least know where I stand and where I have always stood is because they are trying to beat me in this primary.
389	0	They have collected and spent as much as $6 million on these ads.
390	0	"Hedge fund billionaires, Karl Rove, another billionaire, jumped in."
391	0	And why are they doing that?
392	0	These are guys who try to make smart investments.
393	0	"They know my record, they know me, they know that I say what I believe and I will do it."
394	0	And I also have a pretty good understanding about how to stop them.
395	0	"So I do want people to know that, and I think it's important for everybody to understand I have a record, I have stood firm and I will be the person who prevents them from ever wrecking the economy again."
396	0	(APPLAUSE)
397	0	"Senator Sanders, you have been a critic of Secretary Clinton taking those speaking fees and having donations from Wall Street."
398	0	What about her defense of her record?
399	0	Let me just say this.
400	0	Wall Street is perhaps the most powerful economic and political force in this country.
401	0	"You have companies like Goldman Sachs, who just recently paid a settlement fine with the federal government for $5 billion for defrauding investors."
402	0	Goldman Sachs was one of those companies whose illegal activity helped destroy our economy and ruin the lives of millions of Americans.
403	0	But this is what a rigged economy and a corrupt campaign finance system and a broken criminal justice is about.
404	0	"These guys are so powerful that not one of the executives on Wall Street has been charged with anything after paying, in this case of Goldman Sachs, a $5 billion fine."
405	0	"Kid gets caught with marijuana, that kid has a police record."
406	0	"A Wall Street executive destroys the economy, $5 billion settlement with the government, no criminal record."
407	0	That is what power is about.
408	0	That is what corruption is about.
409	0	And that is what has to change in the United States of America.
410	0	(APPLAUSE)
411	0	(CROSSTALK)
412	0	"If I could, let me just say that of course it has to change."
413	0	It has to change.
414	0	And that's why I have put forward a plan to do just that.
415	0	"And it's been judged to be the toughest, most effective and comprehensive one."
416	0	I have great respect for Senator Sanders's commitment to try to restore Glass-Steagall.
417	0	But I do not believe that that is enough.
418	0	"And in fact, I don't believe it really addresses a lot of the biggest issues we have."
419	0	"You know, we now have power under the Dodd-Frank legislation to break up banks."
420	0	And I've said I will use that power if they pose a systemic risk.
421	0	"But I want to go further, because it was investment banks, it was insurance companies, it was mortgage companies, all of which contributed."
422	0	So let's not just be narrowly focused on one part of the problem.
423	0	We have a lot of issues with corporate power that have to be addressed.
424	0	My plan takes us further and it would do the job.
425	0	(CROSSTALK)
426	0	(APPLAUSE)
427	0	"I would say that -- that folks who have looked at this issue for a long time, whether it's Elizabeth Warren or many other economists, will tell you that right now, yes, we do need a 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation."
428	0	"And I would tell you also that when you have three out of the four largest banks in America today, bigger than they were -- significantly bigger than when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, a good Republican by the way, what he would say is: Break them up; they are too powerful economically; they are too powerful politically."
429	0	And that is what I believe and many economists believe.
430	0	Time to break them up.
431	0	(APPLAUSE)
432	0	"Look we have a law -- look, you know, I -- I appreciate the senator's advocacy."
433	0	We have a law.
434	0	It was passed.
435	0	It was signed by President Obama.
436	0	It lays out a process that you go through to determine whether a systemic risk is posed.
437	0	"And by the way, President Obama signed that, pushed it through, even though he took donations from Wall Street, because he's a responsible president."
438	0	So we have a law in place.
439	0	"If the circumstances warrant it, I will certainly use it."
440	0	"And from what you say, I know you will as well."
441	0	But that is not enough.
442	1	"And I keep going back to this because part of the reason the Wall Street guys are trying so hard to stop me -- the hedge fund guys, the shadow banking guys -- is because I've got their number on all of that."
443	0	And my plan goes so much further to try to prevent the problems of the future.
444	0	"You know, we can't just fight the last war."
445	0	"We've got to be prepared to stop these guys if they ever try to use their economic power once again, to hurt the economy, and to hurt so many Americans."
446	0	"And my plan, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, a lot of experts who understand what the new challenges might be, have said I am exactly on point, and the Wall Street guys actually know that."
447	0	(APPLAUSE)
448	0	(CROSSTALK)
449	0	... she has had more people praise her plan than yours.
450	0	"Well, we've had a number of economists supporting our legislation."
451	0	And here's where we are.
452	0	The American people can judge.
453	0	Six largest financial institutions in America today have assets of roughly $10 trillion; equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of the United States of America.
454	0	That is a lot of money.
455	0	"They issue two thirds of the credit cards, and by the way they're ripping off a whole lot of people with high interest rates on the credit cards, and they write about one third of the mortgages."
456	0	That is a lot of power for six financial institutions.
457	0	That's it.
458	0	I think it is too much power.
459	0	"Too much economic power, too much political power, and the economists that I talk to say we should break them up."
460	0	Thank you both.
461	0	"Let me move on to our next question here, and in fact it comes to us through New England Cable News."
462	0	"Secretary Clinton, it's addressed to you, and it's about this issue of the speeches, particularly to Goldman Sachs."
463	0	This is what the questioner wrote verbatim.
464	0	"I am concerned with the abuses of Wall Street has taken with the American taxpayers money, and then she asks whether you would release the transcripts of your Goldman Sachs speeches, and then added, ""Don't you think the voting public has a right to know what was said?"""
465	0	"But, let's make that bigger."
466	0	Are you willing to release the transcripts of all your paid speeches?
467	0	We do know through reporting that there were transcription services for all of those paid speeches.
468	0	"In full disclosure, would you release all of them?"
469	0	I will look into it.
470	0	"I don't know the status, but I will certainly look into it."
471	0	"But, I can only repeat what is the fact that I spoke to a lot of different groups with a lot of different constituents, a lot of different kinds of members about issues that had to do with world affairs."
472	0	I probably described more times than I can remember how stressful it was advising the President about going after Bin Laden.
473	0	My view on this is look at my record.
474	0	"Look at what I am proposing, and -- we have a vigorous agreement here."
475	0	We both want to reign in the excesses of Wall Street.
476	0	"I also want to reign in the excesses of Johnson Controls that we bailed out when they were an autoparts company, and we saved the auto industry, and now they want to avoid paying taxes."
477	0	"I want to go after the pharmaceutical companies like Valeant, and Turns that are increasing prices without any regard to the impact on people's health."
478	0	"Now, if all we're going to talk about is one part of our economy, and indeed one streak in our economy, we're missing the big oil companies."
479	0	We're missing other big energy companies.
480	0	"We're missing the big picture, and I have a record of trying to go at the problems that actually exist, and I will continue to do that."
481	0	"Senator, you sound like you want to respond."
482	0	Go ahead.
483	0	"Yeah, I do."
484	0	"I agree with much of what the Secretary said, but, madam Secretary, it is not one streak."
485	0	Wall Street is an entity of unbelievable economic and political power.
486	0	That's a fact.
487	0	"And, I want to say something, and it may sound harsh, not to you, but to the American people."
488	0	"In a sense, in my view, the business model of Wall Street is fraud."
489	0	It's fraud.
490	0	"I believe that corruption is rampant, and the fact that major bank after major bank has reached multi billion dollar settlements with the United States government when we have a weak regulator system tells me that not only did we have to bail them out once, if we don't start breaking them up, we're going to have to bail them out again, and I do not want to see that happen..."
491	0	"... Well, Senator, no one wants to see that happen."
492	0	"I mean, look, I care deeply about this because just like you I have met so many people who had their life savings wiped out, who lost their homes, who are barely back with their heads above water."
493	0	"This was a disaster for our country, and we can never let that happen again."
494	0	We have no disagreement about this.
495	0	"But, I think it's a broader target list than just Wall Street, and I believe that we have to be very focused on how we try to take back the power and increase the empowerment of the American people."
496	0	"And, I think I have that kind of experience, maybe because they've beat me up for so many years, and I know exactly how to handle them because I've been in the arena with them time and time again."
497	0	"Senator Sanders, let me turn to, I think, where this direction is heading anyway, which is the broader issue of big business and power in our political system."
498	0	"You on the campaign trail have railed against big name American corporations like Boeing, and General Electric, and Wal Mart."
499	0	"But, some big businesses in this country have also been part of advancing progressive goals like that nationwide initiative to expand employment opportunities for veterans."
500	0	That was all about cooperation between the Obama administration and some very big business.
501	0	"The Affordable Care Act, some of the thorniest problems in that bill were worked out in cooperation with big business in order to accomplish progressive goals."
502	0	"Could you work with them, or have you made enemies of big business in this country with the way you've approached them in this campaign?"
503	0	"Of course I can work with them, but let's be clear."
504	0	"When I talked about Boeing and I talked about General Electric, what I was referring to is an outrage."
505	0	I suspect the secretary agrees request me.
506	0	"Right now you have a loophole such that these guys are putting their profits, multi-billion dollar profitable corporations putting billions of dollars into the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and other tax havens."
507	0	"And in a given year, Rachel, after making billions of dollars in profit, do you know how much they're paying in taxes to the United States government in a given year?"
508	0	Zero.
509	0	Now explain to me how that makes any sense at all.
510	0	"So what I have said with regard to Boeing and GE and other multinationals that pay zero taxes, you know what we're going to do?"
511	0	We're going to end that loophole.
512	0	They are going to pay their fair share of taxes.
513	0	We're going to use that money to rebuild our infrastructure and create up to 13 million jobs.
514	0	Can I work with corporations?
515	0	Are there good corporations doing incredible cutting edge research and development?
516	0	Absolutely they are.
517	0	And we should be proud of them.
518	0	"But on the other hand, there are many corporations who have turned their backs on the American worker, who have said, if I can make another nickel in profit by going to China and shutting down in the United States of America, that's what I will do."
519	0	I will do my best to transform our trade policy and take on these corporations who want to invest in low-income countries around the world rather than in the United States of America.
520	0	(APPLAUSE)
521	0	"Senator Sanders, thank you."
522	0	"And with that, we're going to take a break."
523	0	We'll be right back.
524	0	And we're going to get to trade and a lot of other issues.
525	0	(APPLAUSE)
526	0	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
527	0	Welcome back -- welcome back to the Democratic candidates' debate.
528	0	"We're going to be talking about America in the world, both in terms of some trade issues, but also national security."
529	0	"And Secretary Clinton, we're going to start with you."
530	0	"There are more than 4,000 American troops back in Iraq right now as part of the fight against ISIS."
531	0	"It has been 15 straight years of wars and multiple deployments for America's military families, who have borne such a disproportionate burden."
532	0	Is President Obama right to keep escalating the number of U.S. troops that's fighting ISIS right now?
533	0	"Well, I think what the president understands, and what he's trying to do, is that we have to support the Arab and Kurdish fighters on the ground who are actually doing the fighting."
534	0	I agree with the president.
535	0	"I've said myself, we will not send American combat troops back to either Syria or Iraq -- that is off the table."
536	0	"But we do have special forces, we do have trainers, we do have the military personnel who are helping with the airstrikes that the United States is leading so that we can try to take out ISIS infrastructure, take out their leadership."
537	0	"And I think that, given the threat that ISIS poses to the region and beyond, as we have sadly seen in our own country, it is important to keep the Iraqi army on a path where they can actually take back territory, to work with the Sunni tribes in Anbar province and elsewhere so that their fighters can be also deployed, to work with the Kurds to provide them the support, but they're doing the fighting."
538	0	We're doing the support and enabling.
539	0	"And I also think we've got to do more to stop foreign fighters, foreign funding and take ISIS on online, as well as doing everything necessary to keep us safe at home."
540	0	"So as I look at what the president it doing, it adds up to me. We just have to keep -- try to get more support for those people on the ground in Syria and Iraq who have to actually physically take the territory back."
541	0	"To be clear, to the specific question, if that strategic goal that you're describing requires considerably more of Americans -- an ever-increasing number of Americans in Iraq and maybe in Syria, are you OK with the numbers increasing?"
541	0	No.
542	0	"I mean, of course that's a theoretical question, and we don't know what it would be for, and we don't know how many numbers there are."
543	0	I am against American combat troops being in Syria and Iraq.
544	0	I support special forces.
545	0	I support trainers.
546	0	I support the air campaign.
547	0	And I think we're making some progress.
548	0	"I want to continue to intensify that, and that's exactly what the president is doing."
549	0	"Thank you, Madam Secretary."
550	0	"Go ahead, Senator Sanders -- 30 seconds, your response."
551	0	"OK. Let me agree with much of what the secretary said, but where we have a different background on this issue is we differ on the war in Iraq, which created barbaric organizations like ISIS."
552	0	"Not only did I vote against that war, I helped lead the opposition, and if you go to my website, berniesanders.com, you will see the statement that I made in 2002."
553	0	"And it gives me no pleasure to tell you that much of what I feared would happen the day after Saddam Hussein was overthrown, in fact, did happen."
554	0	All right.
555	0	"Senator, I want to stay, though..."
556	0	If I could -- if I could...
557	0	Go ahead.
558	0	30 seconds.
559	0	"... respectfully add -- look, we did differ."
560	0	A vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS.
561	0	We have to look at the threats that we face right now...
562	0	(APPLAUSE)
563	0	... and we have to be prepared to take them on and defeat them.
564	0	Let me -- let -- we're gonna -- we're staying -- we're staying basically on this topic.
565	0	"Obviously you've been emphasizing this difference on the Iraq war, but one place where you do agree, and one place where you voted to authorize the use of force, was in favor of the war in Afghanistan."
566	0	"Right now, it is possible President Obama is going to be leaving the next president, perhaps President Sanders, at least 10,000 troops in Afghanistan."
567	0	How long will those troops be in Afghanistan under President Sanders?
568	0	"Well, I think our great task is to make certain that our young men and women in the military do not get sucked into never- ending, perpetual warfare within the quagmire of Syria and Iraq."
569	0	And I will do my very best to make sure that that doesn't happen.
570	0	I agree with the secretary that I think what has to happen -- and let me just mention what King Abdullah of Jordan said.
571	0	I think he hit the nail on the head.
572	0	And what he said is essentially the war against ISIS is a war for the soul of Islam.
573	0	"And it must be Muslim troops on the ground that will destroy ISIS, with the support of a coalition of major powers -- U.S., U.K., France, Germany and Russia."
574	0	So our job is to provide them the military equipment that they need; the air support they need; special forces when appropriate.
575	0	"But at the end of the day for a dozen different reasons, not the least of which is that ISIS would like American combat troops on the ground so they could reach out to the Muslim world and say, ""Look, we're taking on those terrible Americans."""
576	0	The combat on the ground must be done by Muslim troops with our support.
577	0	We must not get involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
578	0	Can you address a question on Afghanistan?
579	0	(APPLAUSE)
580	0	(CROSSTALK)
581	0	How long are these troops going to be there?
582	0	"If President Obama leaves you 10,000 troops, how long do you think they're going to be there?"
583	0	"Well, you can't simply withdraw tomorrow."
584	0	"Wish we could, and allow, you know, the Taliban or anybody else to reclaim that country."
585	0	"But what we must do, and what we have seen in recent months, is some progress in Iraq, where finally the Iraqi army, which has not been a particularly effective fighting force, retook Ramadi."
586	0	ISIS has lost I think 40 percent of the territory that it held in the last year.
587	0	"Hopefully, and you know, one can't predict the future, that maybe our training and their fighting capabilities are improving and we are going to make some progress in destroying ISIS."
588	0	"Secretary Clinton, 30 seconds: How long are these troops going to be in Afghanistan?"
589	0	We have more American troops in Afghanistan than what we were talking about with Iraq.
590	0	"Oh, absolutely."
591	0	The president decided to leave more troops than he had originally planned in Afghanistan.
592	0	"We have a very cooperative government there, with Ashraf Ghani and his top -- his top partner, Abdullah."
593	0	And they are doing their very best.
594	0	And the Afghan army is actually fighting.
595	0	The Afghan army is taking heavy losses defending Afghan territory.
596	0	And I would have to make an evaluation based on the circumstances at the time I took office as to how much help they continue to need.
597	0	Because it's not just the Taliban.
598	0	"We now are seeing outposts of, you know, fighters claiming to be affiliated with ISIS."
599	0	"So, we've got this arc of instability from North Africa to South Asia, and we have to pay close attention to it."
600	0	"And we have to build coalitions, something that I did to take on the Iranian nuclear program, and what I will do as president to make sure that we defeat these terrorist networks."
601	0	"You know, Senator Sanders, nobody knows who your foreign policy advisers are."
602	0	You haven't given a major foreign policy speech.
603	0	"And it doesn't sound like all the time that foreign policy is a priority, other than when you're asked about it, and you say you're going to crush ISIS, as you said last night and earlier."
604	0	You have not proactively laid out a foreign policy doctrine yet.
605	0	Why?
606	0	"Well, that's not quite accurate."
607	0	I did give a speech at Georgetown where I talked about democratic socialism and foreign policy.
608	0	"Maybe I shouldn't have combined the two in the same speech, because the foreign policy part of it didn't get much attention."
609	0	"So, let me take this opportunity to give you a very short speech here on the issue."
610	0	"I think, while it is true that the secretary and I voted differently on the war in Iraq, what is important is that we learn the lesson of the war in Iraq."
611	0	"And that lesson is intrinsic to my foreign policy if elected president, is the United States cannot do it alone."
612	0	We cannot be the policeman of the world.
613	0	We are now spending more I believe than the next eight countries on defense.
614	0	We have got to work in strong coalition with the major powers of the world and with those Muslim countries that are prepared to stand up and take on terrorism.
615	0	"So I would say that the key doctrine of the Sanders administration would be no, we cannot continue to do it alone; we need to work in coalition."
616	0	(APPLAUSE)
617	0	(CROSSTALK)
618	0	"A group of national security experts, military intelligence experts, issued a very concerning statement about Senator Sanders's views on foreign policy and national security, pointing out some of the comments he has made on these issues, such as inviting Iranian troops into Syria to try to resolve the conflict there; putting them right at the doorstep of Israel."
619	0	"Asking Saudi Arabia and Iran to work together, when they can't stand each other and are engaged in a proxy battle right at this moment."
620	0	"So I do think questions have been raised and questions have to be answered because when New Hampshire voters go on Tuesday to cast your vote, you are voting both for a president and a commander in chief."
621	0	"And there is no way to predict what comes in the door of that White House from day to day that can pose a threat to the United States or one of our friends and allies, and I think this is a big part of the job interview that we are all conducting with the voters here."
622	0	"All right, Senator, 30 seconds."
623	0	(APPLAUSE)
624	0	"(OFF-MIKE) I fully, fully concede that Secretary Clinton, who was secretary of State for four years, has more experience -- hat is not arguable -- in foreign affairs."
625	0	"But experience is not the only point, judgment is."
626	0	"And once again, back in 2002, when we both looked at the same evidence about the wisdom of the war in Iraq, one of us voted the right way and one of us didn't."
627	0	"In terms of Iran and in terms of Saudi Arabia, of course they hate each other."
628	0	That's no great secret.
629	0	"But John Kerry, who is I think doing a very good job, has tried to at least get these people in the room together because both of them are being threatened by ISIS."
630	0	"Well, let me just add that, you know, I've said this before and I'm very proud of it, that when it comes to judgment, having run a hard race against Senator Obama at the time, he turned to me to be secretary of State."
631	0	"And when it comes to the biggest counterterrorism issues that we faced in this administration, namely whether or not to go after bin Laden, I was at that table, I was exercising my judgment to advise the president on what to do, on that, on Iran, on Russia on China, on a whole raft of issues."
632	0	Because I know from my own experience that you've got to be ready on day one.
633	0	"There is just too much unpredictable threat and danger in the world today, you know, to try to just say wait, I'll get to that when I can."
634	0	That is just not an acceptable approach.
635	0	Well...
636	0	"Secretary Clinton, at the -- at the last Democratic debate in Charleston -- I want to get specific here -- Senator Sanders called for moving as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran."
637	0	Your campaign has criticized him for saying that.
638	0	"Now that he's standing next to you here on this stage, can you explain why the U.S. shouldn't try to normalize relations in Iran in your view?"
639	0	Absolutely.
640	0	"You know, I did put together the coalition to impose sanctions."
641	0	"I actually started the negotiations that led to the nuclear agreement, sending some much my closest aides to begin the conversations with the Iranians."
642	0	I'm very pleased we got that nuclear agreement.
643	0	It puts a lid on the nuclear weapons program.
644	0	"We have to enforce it, there have to be consequences attached to it."
645	0	But that is not our only problem with Iran.
646	0	We have to figure out how to deal with Iran as the principal state sponsor of terrorism in the world.
647	0	They are destabilizing governments in the region.
648	0	They continue to support Hezbollah and Hamas in Lebanon against Israel.
649	0	A lot of work that we have do is going to be incredibly hard.
650	0	"I'm prepared to do that work, but I believe, just as I did with imposing the sanctions, you have to get action for action."
651	0	"If we were to normalize relations right now, we would remove one of the biggest pieces of leverage we have to try to influence and change Iranian behavior."
652	0	The president doesn't think we should.
653	0	I certainly don't think we should.
654	0	"I believe we have to take this step by step to try to reign in Iranian aggression, their support for terrorism and the other bad behavior that can come back and haunt us."
655	0	Who said That think we should normalize relations with Iran tomorrow?
656	0	I never said that.
657	0	I think we should move forward as quickly as we can.
658	0	And you're right.
659	0	They are a sponsor of terrorism around the world and we have to address that.
660	0	"But you know, a number of years ago, people were saying normal relationship with Cuba, what a bad and silly idea."
661	0	"They're Communists, they are our enemy."
662	0	Well guess what?
663	0	Change has come.
664	0	So please don't suggest that I think we normalize relations with Tehran tomorrow.
665	0	We don't.
666	0	"But I would like to see us move forward, and hopefully some day that will happen."
667	0	"And I would say if I might, Madam Secretary -- and you can correct me if I'm wrong."
668	1	When you ran against Senator Obama you thought him naive because he thought it was a good idea to talk to our enemies.
669	0	I think those are exactly the people you have to talk to and you have to negotiate with.
670	0	(APPLAUSE)
671	0	"Well Senator, let me just correct the record if I can."
672	0	You know -- let me correct the record.
673	0	(CROSSTALK)
674	0	"30 seconds, madam secretary."
675	0	"As I -- as I certainly recall, the question was to meet with without conditions."
676	0	"And you're right, I was against that."
677	0	I was against it then I would be against it now.
678	0	OK.
679	0	"Part of diplomacy, the hard work of diplomacy is trying to extract whatever concessions you can get, and giving something the other side wants."
680	0	"Of course you've got to try to make peace with, and work with those who are your adversaries, but you don't just rush in, open the door, and say, ""Here I am. Let's talk and make a deal."""
681	0	That's not the way it works.
682	0	"I think President Obama had the right idea, and the bottom line is that of course there have to be conditions."
683	0	"But, of course it doesn't do us any good to not talk with our adversaries..."
684	0	"... Well, we set conditions on Iran."
685	0	"We worked hard to get them established, and to be enforced, and then we talked."
686	0	That's exactly the right...
687	0	(CROSSTALK)
688	0	"... And, that's what I did with the President, so he and I are on the very same page."
689	0	(APPLAUSE)
690	0	"Just to set the record straight, I very strongly supported the agreement which makes certain that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon."
691	0	"Alright, as Commander in Chief, Senator Sanders, you've got to prioritize potential threats to the United States."
692	0	"Three countries, North Korea, Iran, Russia."
693	0	How would you rank them in order of their threat to America's security right now...
694	0	... ISIS...
695	0	Starting with the biggest threat.
696	0	"ISIS, you forgot one..."
697	0	I didn't say that...
698	0	"... No, no..."
699	0	... No...
700	0	... ISIS would be ...
701	0	... We already had that.
702	0	I'm talking about these three countries.
703	0	"How would you orient our national security, our national defense posture."
704	0	"Clearly North Korea is a very strange situation because it is such an isolated country run by a handful of dictators, or maybe just one, who seems to be somewhat paranoid."
705	0	"And, who had nuclear weapons."
706	0	"And, our goal there, in my view, is to work and lean strongly on China to put as much pressure."
707	0	"China is one of the few major countries in the world that has significant support for North Korea, and I think we got to do everything we can to put pressure on China."
708	0	"I worry very much about an isolated, paranoid country with atomic bombs."
709	0	"I think, clearly, we got to work closely with China to resolve the serious problems we have, and I worry about Putin and his military adventurism in the Crimea and the Ukraine."
710	0	"Secretary of Defense Ash Carter this week picked one of those three, and he has said Russia is, basically, the most important national security threat."
711	0	Sort of reorienting the defense and the challenges to that.
712	0	Do you agree with his decisions...
713	0	"... No, I don't."
714	0	"I worry very, very much about an isolated country."
715	0	That's what makes me nervous.
716	0	Russia lives in the world.
717	0	China lives in the world.
718	0	"North Korea is a very, very strange country because it is so isolated, and I do feel that a nation with nuclear weapons, they have got to be dealt with."
719	0	Dealt with effectively.
720	0	"Secretary Clinton, what do you think of Secretary of Defense Ash Carter."
721	0	"He's basically putting Russia above Iran, above North Korea, as sort of the chief national security challenge right now."
722	0	"I haven't talked to Secretary Carter, but here's what I would think he's planning."
723	0	"We do have the nuclear weapons agreement with Iran, that's an enforcement consequence, action for action, follow on."
724	0	"We have a plan, we will watch them, we will be vigilant."
725	0	We do have to worry about North Korea.
726	0	"They continue to develop their nuclear weapons capability, and they're working very hard on their ballistic missile capability."
727	0	"And, I know that some of those plans could very well lead to a missile that might reach Hawaii, if not the West Coast."
728	0	"We do have to try to get the countries in the region to work with us to do everything we can to confine, and constrain them."
729	0	"But, what Secretary Carter is looking at is the constant pressure that Russia's putting on our European allies."
730	0	The way that Russia is trying to move the boundaries of the post-World War II Europe.
731	0	"The way that he is trying to set European countries against one another, seizing territory, holding it in Crimea."
732	0	Beginning to explore whether they could make some inroads in the Baltics.
733	0	We know that they are deeply engaged in supporting Assad because they want to have a place in the Middle East.
734	0	"They have a naval base, they have an air base in Syria."
735	0	They want to hang on to that.
736	0	"I think what Secretary Carter is seeing, and I'm glad he is, is that we got to get NATO back working for the common defense."
737	0	"We've got to do more to support our partners in NATO, and we have to send a very clear message to Putin that this kind of belligerence, that this kind of testing of boundaries will have to be responded to."
738	0	"The best way to do that is to put more armor in, put more money from the Europeans in so they're actually contributing more to their own defense."
739	0	"Thank you both, Rachel?"
740	0	"Secretary Clinton, I want to ask you about a national security issue that is closer to home."
741	0	"There are thousands of veterans, over 100,000 veterans living in the state of New Hampshire."
742	0	"If either one of you is nominated as the Democratic Party's nominee, you will likely face a Republican opponent in the general election who wants to privatize or even abolish big parts of the V.A."
743	0	It's a newly popular idea in conservative politics.
744	0	How will you win the argument on that issue given the problems that have been exposed at the V.A.
745	0	in the last few years?
746	0	What's your argument that the V.A.
747	0	should still exist and should not be privatized?
748	0	"Well, first of all, I'm absolutely against privatizing the V.A."
749	0	And I am going do everything I can to build on the reforms that Senator Sanders and others in Congress have passed to try to fix what's wrong with the V.A.
750	0	There are a lot of issues about wait times and services that have to be fixed because our veterans deserve nothing but the best.
751	0	"But you're absolutely right, you know, Rachel, this is another part of the Koch brothers agenda."
752	0	"They've actually formed an organization to try to begin to convince Americans we should no longer have guaranteed health care, specialized care for our veterans."
753	0	I will fight that as hard as I can.
754	0	"I think there's where we can enlist the veterans service organizations, the veterans of America, because, yes, let's fix the V.A., but we will never let it be privatized, and that is a promise."
755	0	(APPLAUSE)
756	0	"Senator Sanders, you, as a congressional leader on veterans issues and the Veterans Committee, you've worked in a very bipartisan way with Senator John McCain and others on veterans issues."
757	0	"Is the right contour of the fight, the way she's talking about this issue?"
758	0	Let me agree.
759	0	"You know, as the secretary knows, I chaired -- I had the privilege and the honor of chairing the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs."
760	0	"And it is interesting to me, you know, Republicans give a lot of speeches about how much they love veterans."
761	0	"I work with the American Legion, the VFW, the DAV, the Vietnam Vets, and virtually every veterans organization to put together the most comprehensive piece of the veterans legislation in the modern history of America."
762	0	That's what I did.
763	0	And I brought it to the floor of the Senate.
764	0	"Every Democrat voted for it, I got two Republicans."
765	0	We ended up with 56 votes and I couldn't get the 60 votes that I needed.
766	0	That is pathetic.
767	0	"This was legislation supported by all of the veterans organizations, addressing many of the serious problems that veterans face in health care and in how we deliver benefits to them."
768	0	"So Republicans talk a good game about veterans, but when it came to put money on the line to protect our veterans, frankly, they were not there."
769	0	"What I did next, Rachel, is I had to retreat a little bit, I had to compromise."
770	0	I did work with John McCain.
771	0	I did work with Jeff Miller over in the House.
772	0	"And we put together not the bill that I wanted, but probably the most comprehensive V.A."
773	0	health care bill in the modern history of this country.
774	0	"Secretary Clinton is absolutely right, there are people, Koch brothers among others, who have a group called Concerned Veterans of America, funded by the Koch brothers."
775	0	"The Koch brothers, by the way, want to destroy Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, every governmental program passed since the 1930s."
776	0	"Yes, there are people out there who want to privatize it."
777	0	The last point that I'd make.
778	0	I had a hearing.
779	0	I had all of the veterans groups in front of me.
780	0	"And I said to them, tell me when a veteran gets in to the V.A., understanding there are waiting lines and real problems, when a veteran gets into the system, is the quality of care good?"
781	0	"Without exception, what they said, good, excellent, very good."
782	0	We've got to strengthen the V.A.
783	0	We do not privatize the V.A.
784	0	(APPLAUSE)
785	0	"Thank you, Senator."
786	0	"Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton, we're going to take another break."
787	0	We'll be talking about Social Security and some of those other issues when we come back.
788	0	(APPLAUSE)
789	0	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
790	0	(APPLAUSE)
791	0	And we are back.
792	0	"We're gonna get into a little bit of election politics, electability, in a little bit."
793	0	"Senator Sanders, The Iowa Democratic Party has declared Hillary Clinton the winner of Monday's Iowa caucuses -- narrowest of margins."
794	0	"Today, the Des Moines Register has an editorial that calls for the audit of the results, saying, quote, ""what happened Monday night at the Democratic caucuses was a debacle, period. The results were too close not to do a complete audit."""
795	0	"Senator Sanders, do you accept the idea that Hillary Clinton won Iowa?"
796	0	And do you -- or do you believe the caucuses are still an open question?
797	0	"Well, I agree with the Des Moines Register, but let's not blow this out of proportion."
798	0	"This is not a -- this is not, like, a winner-take-all thing."
799	0	"I think where we now stand -- correct me if I'm wrong -- you have 22 delegates, I have 20 delegates."
800	0	"We need 2,500 delegates to win the nomination."
801	0	(LAUGHTER)
802	0	"You know, so this is not -- this is not the biggest deal in the world."
803	0	"We think, by the way, based on talking to our precinct captains, we may have at least two more delegates."
804	0	"What the Des Moines Register said -- you know, there were coin -- I think there were half a dozen coin flips -- a fairly chaotic type situation."
805	0	"At the end of the day, no matter how it's recounted, it will break roughly even."
806	0	"And by the way, I love and respect the caucus process in Iowa."
807	0	"See, and I don't have to say it, because they voted already."
808	0	(LAUGHTER)
809	0	"And I love New Hampshire, too, because you haven't voted, but..."
810	0	(APPLAUSE)
811	0	"... but, look, I think people are blowing this up out of proportion."
812	0	But I think we need improvements in the process by which results are determined.
813	0	"Secretary Clinton, will you participate in some sort of audit, if that's what the party wants to do?"
814	0	You good with that?
815	0	"Whatever they decide to do, that's fine."
816	0	That's fair enough.
817	0	OK.
818	0	All right.
819	0	"Good, we move on."
820	0	We're happy with that.
821	0	We have more questions.
822	0	"Senator -- Senator Sanders, in 1964..."
823	0	Oh (inaudible).
824	0	(LAUGHTER)
825	0	"See, when you are old, then they go back all these years."
826	0	All right.
827	0	What have you got?
828	0	"In 1964, I heard that the Republicans nominated Barry Goldwater, who was the hero of the conservative movement."
829	0	"He was, however, far to the right of most of that party."
830	0	"In 1972, the Democrats nominated George McGovern, who was a hero of liberals in the antiwar movement, but he was to the left of his party's mainstream."
831	0	"Both of those nominees made activists very excited, and they both got destroyed in the general election."
832	0	Even Democrats who love you worry about your fate in a general election.
833	0	And I know you have good head-to-head polling numbers against Republican frontrunners right now.
834	0	We know that.
835	0	But do you have a general election strategy that is different than the way you're running right now to try to get the nomination?
836	0	"Well, you know, a general election is different than a primary and caucus process."
837	0	But let me just say this.
838	0	"In terms of where we are right now, as you mention, Rachel, in a number of national and state, including New Hampshire."
839	0	"For example, the last poll I saw -- there may have been a new one -- last one I saw here in New Hampshire, a battleground state, had me defeating Trump by 19; the secretary defeating him by one."
840	0	There were also pretty large margins in Iowa and Wisconsin.
841	0	These are polls.
842	0	Polls go up.
843	0	Polls go down.
844	0	"But here's why I think I will be, if nominated, the strongest candidate."
845	1	"Democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people, middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process."
846	1	"Republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout, which by the way is why they love voter suppression."
847	0	"I believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people, from young people, who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout."
848	1	"If there is a large voter turnout, not only do we retain the White House, but I think we regain the Senate."
849	0	We win governors' chairs up and down the line.
850	1	"So I believe if you want to retain the White House, if you want to see Democrats do well across the board, I think our campaign is the one that creates the large voter turnout and helps us win."
851	0	(APPLAUSE)
852	0	"Secretary Clinton, your campaign surrogates, and people who have endorsed you, have suggested that or even said that if Senator Sanders is the nominee, that Democrats will suffer nationwide and the chances will go down of Democrats holding onto the White House."
853	0	"With him here standing next to you, can you tell us whether or not you believe he would win the general election if he were nominated?"
854	0	"I can only tell you what I believe, and that is that I am the strongest candidate to take it to the Republicans and win in November."
855	0	(APPLAUSE)
856	0	And I say that with great -- with great respect for the campaign that Senator Sanders has been running.
857	0	"I personally am thrilled at the numbers of people, and particularly young people who are coming to support your campaign."
858	0	I hope that I will be able to earn their support.
859	0	"They may not support me now, but I support them and we'll work together."
860	0	"But what I'm concerned about is the views of many Democrats who know their states, who know how hard it is to win a general election."
861	0	And it also will push whoever the nominee is into the spotlight.
862	0	I've been vetted.
863	0	There's hardly anything you don't know about me.
864	0	"And I think it's fair to say that whoever is in that position, Senator Sanders or anyone else who might have run, will face the most withering onslaught."
865	0	"So, I think that I am the person who can do all aspects of the job."
866	0	I think I'm the person best prepared to take the case to the Republicans.
867	0	"And I think that at the end of the day, it's not so much electability."
868	0	"It is who the American people can believe can keep them safe, can get the economy moving again, can get incomes rising, can build on the progressive accomplishments of President Obama."
869	0	And I think that the coalition that President Obama put together to win twice is a coalition that I can put together and add to.
870	0	And that's what I'm prepared to...
871	0	(APPLAUSE)
872	0	(CROSSTALK)
873	0	We'll stay on this issue.
874	0	We'll stay on this topic.
875	0	"Secretary Clinton, just like there are some Democrats that question Senator Sanders' ability in the general election, many Democratic voters that our reporters have been running into in Iowa and New Hampshire, they tell our reporters over and over again they're worried about the emails issue, not because they don't believe your explanation, but because it's a drip-drip, because the cloud is hanging over your head and that it will impact the general election."
876	0	They see your numbers right now and they think it's the email issue as to why you're not polling very well.
877	0	So can you reassure these Democrats that somehow the email issue isn't going to blow up your candidacy if you're the nominee?
878	0	Absolutely I can.
879	0	"You know, before it was emails, it was Benghazi, and the Republicans were stirring up so much controversy about that."
880	0	"And I testified for 11 hours, answered their questions."
881	0	"They basically said yeah, didn't get her."
882	0	We tried.
883	0	That was all a political ploy.
884	0	"Now, we had a development in the email matter today when it came out that Secretary Powell and close aides to Former Secretary Rice used private e-mail accounts."
885	0	"and now you have these people in the government who are doing the same thing to Secretary Powell and Secretary Rice's aide they've been doing to me, which is that I never sent or received any classified material."
886	0	They are retroactively classifying it.
887	0	"I agree completely with Secretary Powell, who said today this is an absurdity."
888	0	And so I think the American people will know it's an absurdity.
889	0	I have absolutely no concerns about it whatsoever.
890	0	(APPLAUSE)
891	0	"All right, Madam Secretary, there is an open -- there is an open FBI investigation into this matter about how you may have handled classified material."
892	0	Are you 100 percent confident that nothing is going to come of this FBI investigation?
893	0	I am 100 percent confident.
894	0	This is a security review that was requested.
895	0	It is being carried out.
896	0	It will be resolved.
897	0	"But I have to add if there's going to be a security review about me, there's going to have to be security reviews about a lot of other people, including Republican office holders, because we've got this absurd situation of retroactive classifications."
898	0	"Honest to goodness, this is -- this just beggars the imagination."
899	0	"So I have absolutely no concerns about it, but we've got to get to the bottom of what's really going on here, and I hope that will happen."
900	0	"Well, Senator sanders, you famously at the first debate said you didn't give a darn about her emails; I think you used another (inaudible)."
901	0	(OFF-MIKE)
902	0	You're right.
903	0	I'm trying to -- it's a -- it's a family hour still right now.
904	0	"After 11:00, I'll say it the other way."
905	0	"And you mostly have refrained from commenting on it, but recently you called it a very serious issue, and then the other day you said well she's getting slapped with the email controversy."
906	0	Are you -- how are you feeling about these darn emails now?
907	0	I am feeling exactly the way I felt at the first debate.
908	0	There's a process under way.
909	0	I will not politicize it.
910	0	OK.
911	0	"Senator Sanders, thank you."
912	0	(APPLAUSE)
913	0	"And by the way -- and by the way, if I may, the secretary probably doesn't know that there's not a day that goes by when I am not asked to attack her on that issue, and I have refrained from doing that and I will continue to refrain from doing that."
914	0	(APPLAUSE)
915	0	"Senator Sanders, thank you."
916	0	"Senator, in December, one of your campaign staffers was fired from your campaign for taking voter data essentially from the Clinton campaign."
917	0	You apologized for that when the incident was made public.
918	1	"Your campaign has now been criticized for its operatives essentially impersonating culinary union members wearing union pins in Nevada, and the Nashua Telegraph has complained recently that you falsely implied in an advertisement that they had endorsed you when they did not."
919	0	"None of these issues obviously is the end of the world, but they all are of a piece."
920	0	Are you in some sense losing control of your campaign?
921	0	Not losing control of our campaign.
922	0	"You know, we have hired a whole lot of people in a rapid way and I am familiar with the first two instances and they are unacceptable, and we have apologized and dealt with that."
923	1	"In terms of the last one, as I understand it, we did not suggest that we had the endorsement of a newspaper."
924	0	"Newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates, and to the best of my knowledge, that is what we did."
925	1	"So we never said, never said that somebody, a newspaper endorsed us that did not."
926	0	What we did say is blah blah blah blah was said by the newspaper.
927	0	"Just to follow up on that, the title of the ad in question was Endorsement."
928	0	But that was only for -- that was not to be on television.
929	0	That's an important point.
930	1	"That was just something -- as the secretary knows, you put titles on ads and you send them out, but there was no word in that ad, none, that said that those newspapers had endorsed us."
931	0	"Secretary Clinton, do you want 30 seconds on that issue?"
932	0	No.
933	0	"And with that, we will (inaudible)."
934	0	(APPLAUSE)
935	0	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
936	0	"Welcome back to the University of New Hampshire, and the Democratic candidates' debate."
937	0	"Secretary Clinton, on the issue of the death penalty, here in New Hampshire, the one person who is on death row is there for killing a police officer."
938	0	"It's a crime that has caused anguish in this state, both among death penalty opponents and death penalty supporters."
939	0	"The last time I had the chance to talk with you on this issue, on the death penalty, you said that capital punishment has a place in a very few federal cases, but you also said you would breathe a sigh of relief if the Supreme Court abolished the death penalty nationwide."
940	0	"Tonight, do you still support capital punishment, even if you do so reluctantly?"
941	0	"Yes, I do."
942	0	"And -- you know, what I hope the Supreme Court will do is make it absolutely clear that any state that continues capital punishment either must meet the highest standards of evidentiary (ph) proof of effective assistance of counsel or they cannot continue it because that, to me, is the real dividing line."
943	0	"I have much more confidence in the federal system, and I do reserve it for particularly heinous crimes in the federal system, like terrorism."
944	0	I have strong feelings about that.
945	0	"I thought it was appropriate after a very thorough trial that Timothy McVeigh received the death penalty for blowing up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people, including 19 children in a daycare center."
946	0	"I do for very limited, particularly heinous crimes believe it is an appropriate punishment, but I deeply disagree with the way that too many states are still implementing it."
947	0	"If it were possible to separate the federal from the state system by the Supreme Court, that would, I think, be an appropriate outcome."
948	0	"Senator Sanders, you have singled out the death penalty, and Senator Clinton's support for the death penalty, as an issue that makes it hard to consider as progressive in your mind..."
949	0	"... Look, I hear what the Secretary said, and I understand, but look, there are -- all of us know that we have seen in recent years horrible, horrible crimes."
950	0	"It's hard to imagine how people can do, bomb, and kill 168 people in Oklahoma City, or do the Boston Marathon bombing, but this is what I believe, and for a couple of reasons."
951	0	"Number one, too many innocent people, including minorities, African Americans, have been executed when they were not guilty."
952	0	That's number one.
953	0	We have to be very careful about making sure about that.
954	0	"But, second of all, and maybe, in a deeper reason, of course there are barbaric acts out there."
955	0	"But, in a world of so much violence and killing, I just don't believe that government itself should be part of the killing."
956	0	"So, when somebody commits..."
957	0	(APPLAUSE)
958	0	"... Somebody commits any of these terrible crimes that we have seen, you lock them up, and you toss away the key."
959	0	They're never going to get out.
960	0	"But, I just don't' want to see government be part of killing."
961	0	That's all.
962	0	(APPLAUSE)
963	0	"Another issue related to the proper role of government, and in this case, specifically the role of government between the federal government and the states."
964	0	"I want to talk for a moment about the issue of Flint, Michigan."
965	0	"On the Flint lead poisoning disaster, you have both been highly critical of Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan, and how the state in Michigan both caused the lead poisoning problem, and has not acted fast enough to fix it."
966	0	You have both been outspoken on that.
967	0	The fact is that Michigan though has not fixed it.
968	0	There is no door to door delivery of clean water in Flint even today.
969	0	"Not a single lead pipe has been replaced in Flint, even today."
970	0	"If the state is failing, would you, Secretary Clinton, would you as President order a federal response to get it right over and above the wishes of the state?"
971	0	Absolutely.
972	0	Absolutely.
973	0	"You know, Rachel, you and I have talked about this before."
974	0	I thank you for going to Flint to hold that town hall.
975	0	"I will be in Flint at the Mayor's invitation on Sunday to get an in depth briefing about what is, and is not happening."
976	0	This is an emergency.
977	0	"Everyday that goes by that these people, particularly the children, are not tested so we can know what steps must be taken to try to remediate the effects of the poisoning that they have been living with is a day lost in a child's life."
978	0	"I know from the work that I've done over so many years, lead, the toxic nature of lead can affect you brain development, your body development, your behavior."
979	0	I absolutely believe that what is being done is not sufficient.
980	0	"We need to be absolutely clear about everything that should be done from today to tomorrow, into the future to try to remedy the terrible burden that the people of Flint are bearing."
981	0	"That includes fixing their pipes, it includes guaranteeing whatever healthcare and educational embellishments they may need going forward, and I think the federal government has way where it can bill the state of Michigan."
982	0	"If Michigan won't do it, there have to be ways that we can begin to move, and then make them pay for it, and hold them accountable."
983	0	(APPLAUSE)
984	0	Senator Sanders are there things the President could be doing?
985	0	"President Obama could be ordering, done, right now, in Flint, Michigan that are not being done that you as President would do?"
986	0	Absolutely.
987	0	I think the Secretary described the situation appropriately.
988	0	"You know, I don't go around asking for governor's resignations every day."
989	0	"In fact, I think I never have in my life."
990	0	But I did ask for the resignation of Governor Snyder because his irresponsibility...
991	0	(APPLAUSE)
992	0	... was so outrageous.
993	0	What we are talking about are children being poisoned.
994	0	That's what we're talking about.
995	0	"We don't know, no one knows for sure because they haven't done the appropriate studies, but there's no question that kids' intellectual development may have been impacted."
996	0	We don't know how many thousands.
997	0	The idea that there has not been a dramatic response is beyond comprehension.
998	0	"And when you have one of the, I think, significant public health crises of recent years, of course the federal government comes in."
999	0	"And of course the federal government says, you're not going to be poisoning little kids and impacting their entire lives."
1000	0	Last point on this.
1001	0	And I suspect the secretary agrees.
1002	0	One wonders if this were a white suburban community what kind of response there would have been.
1003	0	(APPLAUSE)
1004	0	"Flint, Michigan, is a poor community."
1005	0	It is disproportionately African-American and minority.
1006	0	And what has happened there is absolutely unacceptable.
1007	0	"Senator, thank you."
1008	0	"Secretary Clinton, let me turn to the issue of trade."
1009	1	In the '90s you supported NAFTA.
1010	1	But you opposed it when you ran for the president in 2008.
1011	1	"As secretary of state, you supported TPP, and then -- which, of course, is that trade agreement with a lot of Asian countries, but you now oppose it as you make your second bid for president."
1012	0	"If elected, should Democrats expect that once you're in office you will then become supportive of these trade agreements again?"
1013	0	"You know, Chuck, I've only had responsibility for voting for trade agreements as a senator."
1014	0	"And I voted a multinational trade agreement when I was senator, the CAFTA agreement, because I did not believe it was in the best interests of the workers of America, of our incomes, and I opposed it."
1015	0	"I did hope that the TPP, negotiated by this administration, would put to rest a lot of the concerns that many people have expressed about trade agreements."
1016	0	And I said that I was holding out that hope that it would be the kind of trade agreement that I was looking for.
1017	0	I waited until it had actually been negotiated because I did want to give the benefit of the doubt to the administration.
1018	1	"Once I saw what the outcome was, I opposed it."
1019	0	Now I have a very clear view about this.
1020	0	We have to trade with the rest of the world.
1021	0	We are 5 percent of the world's population.
1022	0	We have to trade with the other 95 percent.
1023	0	And trade has to be reciprocal.
1024	0	That's the way the global economy works.
1025	0	But we have failed to provide the basic safety net support that American workers need in order to be able to compete and win in the global economy.
1026	0	So it's not just what's in the trade agreement that I'm interested in.
1027	0	I did help to renegotiate the trade agreement that we inherited from President Bush with Korea.
1028	0	We go the UAW on board because of changes we made.
1029	0	"So there are changes that I believe would make a real difference if they could be achieved, but I do not currently support it as it is written."
1030	0	"Well, Senator Sanders, I know you want to respond on this, you have never supported a trade deal since you've been in Congress."
1031	0	Absolutely right.
1032	0	But if you do that as president...
1033	0	(APPLAUSE)
1034	0	"If you do that as president, how are you not essentially letting China, who will do all of these deals around the world, how are you going to prevent China from essentially setting the rules of trade for the world?"
1035	0	"Chuck, I believe in trade, but I do not believe in unfettered free trade."
1036	0	I believe in fair trade which works for the middle class and working families of this country and not just large multinational corporations.
1037	0	I was not only in opposition to NAFTA -- and this is an area where the secretary and I have disagreements.
1038	0	"I was not only in opposition to NAFTA, I was on the picket line in opposition to NAFTA because I understood -- I don't think this is really rocket science."
1039	0	We heard all of the people tell us how many great jobs would be created.
1040	1	"I didn't believe that for a second because I understood what the function of NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, and the TPP is, it's to say to American workers, hey, you are now competing against people in Vietnam who make 56 cents an hour minimum wage."
1041	1	I don't want American workers to compete against people making 56 cents an hour.
1042	0	"I don't want companies shutting down in America, throwing people out on the street, moving to China, and bringing their products back into this country."
1043	0	"So, do I believe in trade?"
1044	0	"Of course, I believe in trade."
1045	1	"But the current trade agreements over the last 30 years were written by corporate America, for corporate America, resulted in the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs, 60,000 factories in America lost since 2001, millions of decent-paying jobs; and also a downward spiral, a race to the bottom where employers say, ""Hey, you don't want to take a cut in pay? We're going to China."""
1046	1	Workers today are working longer hours for lower wages.
1047	0	Trade is one of the reasons for that.
1048	0	(APPLAUSE)
1049	0	All right.
1050	0	Thank you both.
1051	0	"We're going to sneak in one more break here, and when we come back we'll squeeze as many questions as we can before we end this thing."
1052	0	We'll be right back.
1053	0	(APPLAUSE)
1054	0	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
1055	0	(APPLAUSE)
1056	0	All right.
1057	0	Welcome back here in the final minutes.
1058	0	The home stretch.
1059	0	The home stretch of this only Democratic debate in the final week before the primary.
1060	0	"Let me start with you, Secretary Clinton, on this question."
1061	0	"Obviously, President Obama got a lot of ambitious stuff done in his first year and a half."
1062	0	You're going to have to make choices.
1063	0	And there's a lot of heavy lifts.
1064	0	And he made choices.
1065	0	"He did healthcare and it came at the expense, arguably, of immigration reform."
1066	0	"Had he put immigration reform first, perhaps that gets done and healthcare doesn't."
1067	0	"So there are three big lifts that you've talked about: immigration, gun reform, climate change."
1068	0	What do you do first?
1069	0	Because you know the first one is the one you have the best shot at getting done.
1070	0	"Well, I -- I don't accept that premise, Chuck."
1071	0	I think that we've got so much business we have to do.
1072	0	We've talked a lot tonight about what we're against -- we're against income inequality.
1073	0	We're against the abuses of powerful interests.
1074	0	We're against a lot of things.
1075	0	I'm for a lot of things.
1076	0	"I don't want to just stop bad things from happening, I want to start good things from happening."
1077	0	"And I believe, if I'm so fortunate to get the nomination, I will begin to work immediately on putting together an agenda, beginning to talk with members of Congress and others about how we can push forward."
1078	0	"I want to have half a billion more solar panels deployed, the first four years."
1079	0	(APPLAUSE)
1080	0	I want to have enough clean energy to power every home the next four years.
1081	0	"I want us to keep working on the Affordable Care Act, to get not only to 100 percent coverage, but bring down the costs of prescription drugs and out-of-pocket costs."
1082	0	"I want to move forward on paid family leave, on early childhood education, I want us to do more for small businesses."
1083	0	(APPLAUSE)
1084	0	"Small businesses have to create most of the jobs, and we're not creating and growing small businesses."
1085	0	"I think, if you have a smart agenda, you pick the committees that you know have to begin to work on these various pieces -- because that's the way Congress is set up."
1086	0	"You go through different committees, and you really make a big push in the beginning."
1087	0	"Immigration reform, economic revitalization with manufacturing, with infrastructure -- we put it out there, and we begin to work on an ambitious, big, bold agenda that will actually produce the results that I want to see for our country."
1088	0	"All right, but Senator Sanders..."
1089	0	(APPLAUSE)
1090	0	... you've still got to do something first.
1091	0	"As you know, history said -- shows what you pick first is your best shot at getting, and how you prioritize things."
1092	0	"No, let..."
1093	0	"Immigration reform, for instance, fell by the wayside in the first term because of this."
1094	0	I am absolutely supportive of comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for 11 million people today who are living in the shadows.
1095	0	All right?
1096	0	We got to do that.
1097	0	(APPLAUSE)
1098	0	"But you miss -- when you looked at the issues, you missed two of the most important."
1099	0	And that is you're not going to accomplish what has to be done for working families and the middle class unless there is campaign finance reform.
1100	0	(APPLAUSE)
1101	0	"So long as big money interests control the United States Congress, it is gonna be very hard to do what has to be done for working families."
1102	0	So let me be very clear.
1103	0	"No nominee of mine, if I'm elected president, to the United States Supreme Court will get that nomination unless he or she is loud and clear, and says they will vote to overturn Citizens United."
1104	0	(APPLAUSE)
1105	0	"Second point -- second point is that the only way we make change in terms of health care, in terms of dealing with a broken criminal justice system which, today, allows us to have more people in jail than any other country -- largely African-American and Latino -- the only way we create millions of jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure or have a tax system that says to the wealthy that they are going to pay their fair share, is when millions of people become involved in the political process."
1106	0	"No, you just can't negotiate with Mitch McConnell."
1107	0	"Mitch is gonna have to look out the window and see a whole lot of people saying, ""Mitch, stop representing the billionaire class. Start listening to working families."""
1108	0	"And as president, that's what I will work hard on."
1109	0	(APPLAUSE)
1110	0	OK.
1111	0	Thank you.
1112	0	"Secretary Clinton, Republicans, particularly in campaign years, often talk about which departments of government -- which agencies of government they would get rid of if they were elected president."
1113	0	"The EPA, the Department of Education, the Commerce Department, oops -- is -- is there a department of government that you would get rid of?"
1114	0	Or is there a whole new one that you would create?
1115	0	The answer to both of those is no.
1116	0	I'm interested in making what we have work better.
1117	0	I want to streamline programs that are duplicative and redundant.
1118	0	"I want to have a top-to-bottom review about what works and what doesn't work, and be absolutely clear we're getting rid of what doesn't work."
1119	0	I have had the opportunity to run a big agency.
1120	0	I was very flattered when Henry Kissinger said I ran the State Department better -- better than anybody had run it in a long time.
1121	0	So I have an idea of what it's going to take to make our government work more efficiently.
1122	0	"And when you put together a budget, you have to make a lot of hard decisions, but I think it's not appropriate to say ""I'm going to get rid of this, get rid of that"" until you have a very good process that gives you the information about what to do."
1123	0	"But I want to add something else, you know, because look, we have so much work to do in our country, and I think it's the greatest work that Americans will be called to do."
1124	0	"And of course, we have to have people in every community involved in it."
1125	0	"We have to have the political voice, the political grassroots speaking up and speaking out about what we have to try to accomplish in Washington."
1126	0	"But we also need to have a very clear set of goals that we are going to achieve, and we need to level with the American people about what they are, what they will cost, what will be expected of our citizenry."
1127	0	"So I see as president having a constant dialogue with Americans here's what we're trying to get done, here's why I need your help, here's why you may think comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship isn't something you care about, but I'm telling you it will help fix the labor market, it will bring people out of the shadows --"
1128	0	"Thank you, Secretary Clinton."
1129	0	-- it will actually raise wages.
1130	0	You have to make all those connections so that you've got people with you every step of the way.
1131	0	That's what I want to do.
1132	0	Thank you very much.
1133	0	Thank you.
1134	0	(APPLAUSE)
1135	0	"All right, before we go, I want to ask each one of these."
1136	0	"Secretary Clinton, you've made it clear when you look at Senator Sanders, you do not see a president, but do you see --"
1137	0	I never said that.
1138	0	But do you see -- do you see a vice president?
1139	0	(LAUGHTER)
1140	0	Look --
1141	0	Would you unite the party by trying to pick Senator Sanders as your running mate?
1142	0	"Well, I'm certainly going to unite the party, but I'm not -- I'm not getting ahead of myself."
1143	0	I think that would be a little bit presumptuous.
1144	0	"If I'm so fortunate as to be the nominee, the first person I will call to talk to about where we go and how we get it done will be Senator Sanders."
1145	0	(APPLAUSE)
1146	0	"Senator, would you consider the secretary?"
1147	0	I agree with what the secretary said.
1148	0	We shouldn't be getting ahead of ourselves.
1149	0	"And as I have said many times, you know, sometimes in these campaigns, things get a little bit out of hand."
1150	0	"I happen to respect the secretary very much, I hope it's mutual."
1151	0	"And on our worst days, I think it is fair to say we are 100 times better than any Republican candidate."
1152	0	(APPLAUSE)
1153	0	That's true.
1154	0	That's true.
1155	0	(CROSSTALK)
1156	0	"Secretary Clinton, closing statements."
1157	0	You are first.
1158	0	"Well first, thanks to MSNBC and thanks to all of you for holding this debate before the New Hampshire primary."
1159	0	"I am going to campaign as hard as I can between now and Tuesday to earn your votes in that primary, and I hear some talk that people are trying to decide do they vote with their heart, do they vote with their head, I'm asking you to bring both your heart and your head to vote with you on Tuesday because we have a lot of work that can only come because your heart is moved."
1160	0	"You know, we didn't get to talk about the continuing struggles that Americans face with racism, with sexism, with discrimination against the LGBT community, with new Americans, with people with disabilities."
1161	0	"Yes, we have income inequality, we have other forms of inequality that we need to stand up against and absolutely diminish from our society."
1162	0	"So I have been moved by my heart ever since I was a young woman about the age of a lot of Senator Sanders' supporters worrying what I can do to make a difference for my country, and I will bring that heart with me, but I will also tell you we've got to get our heads together to come up with the best answers to solve the problems so that people can have real differences in their lives that will make them better for now and into the future."
1163	0	(APPLAUSE)
1164	0	"Thank you, Madam Secretary."
1165	0	Senator Sanders.
1166	0	I -- my dad came to this country at the age of 17 from Poland.
1167	0	"Didn't have any money, couldn't speak English, he died pretty young, and I think it would have been beyond his wildest dreams to see his son up here on this stage today running for president."
1168	0	"I love this country and my dad loved this country, and he was the most proud American because of what it gave him in terms of raising his family, even though we never had much money."
1169	0	"But today in America, we are the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people, that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave."
1170	1	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth.
1171	0	We are seeing millions of families unable to send their kids to college in the United States of America.
1172	0	I'm running for president because I believe it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.
1173	0	I do believe we need a political revolution where millions of people stand up and say loudly and clearly that our government belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
1174	0	Thank you all.
1175	0	(APPLAUSE)
1176	0	"Well, there you have it."
1177	0	"I promise you, Rachel and I have a lot more questions, but we just don't have any more time, unless we could (inaudible) a third hour, but I don't think so."
1178	0	Our debate coverage -- (inaudible) debate coverage will continue in just a moment with our colleague (inaudible).
1179	0	"And we want to thank all of you for being here, and we want to thank the two candidates for taking part in this important event."
1180	0	"We also want to thank our host, the University of New Hampshire, and the people of New Hampshire."
1181	0	You guys get to vote in just five days.
1182	0	I can't wait to see how it turns out.
1183	0	Don't screw up.
1184	0	We'll see you in a few minutes.
1185	0	Thank you.
1186	0	Thank you.
1187	0	(APPLAUSE)
1	0	It's time for the candidates to introduce themselves right now.
2	0	You'll each have 30 seconds.
3	0	"Dr. Carson, you're first."
4	0	"If someone had tried to describe today's America to you 30 years ago, you would have listened in disbelief."
5	0	"Americans know that our nation is heading off the abyss of destruction, secondary to divisiveness, fiscal irresponsibility, and failure to lead."
6	0	"Marco, Donald, Ted, John, we will not solve any of these problems by trying to destroy each other."
7	0	What we need to do is be looking for solutions tonight.
8	0	"It's not about us, it's about the American people."
9	0	(APPLAUSE)
10	0	Governor Kasich?
11	0	"Well, you know, on the way over here, even getting ready earlier and sitting in the green room and watching the early coverage, you know, my father carried mail on his back and his father was a coal miner and my mother's mother was an immigrant, could barely speak English."
12	0	And I'm standing on this stage.
13	0	It's pretty remarkable.
14	0	"But I want to tell you, there's a lot of young people watching tonight."
15	0	You can do whatever you want to do in your life.
16	0	"America is an amazing country, where a kid like me can grow up to run for president of the United States and be on this stage tonight."
17	0	"So to all the young people that are out there, your hopes, your dreams, pursue them."
18	0	Shoot for the stars.
19	0	"America's great, and you can do it."
20	0	"Thank you, Wolf."
21	0	(APPLAUSE)
22	0	Senator Rubio?
23	0	"Well, thank you."
24	0	"This election, we have to decide the identity of America in the 21st century, but as part of this primary, we have to find out our identity as a party and as a movement."
25	0	"Thirty-six years ago, Ronald Reagan and George H.W."
26	0	Bush began the Reagan Revolution.
27	0	"For a generation, they defined conservatism as limited government and free enterprise and a strong national defense."
28	0	But they also appealed to our hopes and our dreams.
29	0	"Now we have to decide if we are still that kind of party and still that kind of movement, or if we're simply going to become a party that preys on people's angers and fears."
30	0	I hope we remain that conservative movement that appeals to our hopes and our dreams and the belief that America will always be better in its future than it's been in its story history.
31	0	(APPLAUSE)
32	0	Senator Cruz?
33	0	Welcome to Texas.
34	0	(APPLAUSE)
35	0	"Here, Texas provided my family with hope."
36	0	"Here, my mom became the first in her family ever to go to college."
37	0	"Here, my dad fled Cuba and washed dishes, making 50 cents an hour to pay his way through the University of Texas."
38	0	I graduated from high school at Second Baptist not too far away from here.
39	0	"When I ran for Senate, I promised 27 million Texans I would fight for you every day, and not for the Washington bosses."
40	0	"And, I'll tell you, as I travel the state, Democrats tell me I didn't vote for you, but you're doing what you said you would do."
41	0	"And, as president, I will do the same."
42	0	(APPLAUSE)
43	0	Mr. Trump.
44	0	Thank you.
45	0	My whole theme is make America great again.
46	0	We don't win anymore as a country.
47	0	"We don't win with trade, we don't win with the military."
48	0	"ISIS, we can't even knock out ISIS, and we will, believe me."
49	0	We will.
50	0	We don't win in any capacity with healthcare.
51	0	"We have terrible health care, Obamacare is going to be repealed and replaced."
52	0	We just don't win.
53	0	"You look at our borders, they're like swiss cheese, everybody pours in."
54	0	We're going to make a great country again.
55	0	We're going to start winning again.
56	0	"We're going to win a lot, it's going to be a big difference, believe me."
57	0	It's going to be a big difference.
58	0	(APPLAUSE)
59	0	Thank you very much.
60	0	It's now time to begin questions.
61	0	"Voters in the first four states have spoken, and Mr. Trump has emerged as the frontrunner, but in five days the candidates will face their biggest test yet, Super Tuesday."
62	0	"When nearly half of the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination will be awarded, and the biggest prize of the night is Texas."
63	0	"Immigration is a key issue in this state, for all voters nationwide, including the many people watching us on Telemundo."
64	0	"So, that's where we begin."
65	0	"Mr. Trump, you've called for a deportation force to remove the 11 million undocumented immigrants from the United States."
66	0	"You've also promised to let what you call, ""the good ones"", come back in."
67	0	"Your words, ""the good ones"", after they've been deported."
68	0	Senator Cruz would not allow them to come back in.
69	0	He says that's the biggest difference between the two of you.
70	0	He calls your plan amnesty.
71	0	Is it?
72	0	"First of all, he was in charge of amnesty, he was the leader, and you can ask Marco because they've been debating this every debate that we've had."
73	0	"As far as coming back in, number one, you wouldn't even be talking, and you wouldn't have asked that as the first question if it weren't for me when my opening when I talked about illegals immigration."
74	0	It wouldn't even be a big subject.
75	0	"But, we either have a country, or we don't have a country."
76	0	We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally.
77	0	They will go out.
78	0	"They will come back -- some will come back, the best, through a process."
79	0	They have to come back legally.
80	0	"They have to come back through a process, and it may not be a very quick process, but I think that's very fair, and very fine."
81	0	They're going to get in line with other people.
82	0	"The best of them will come back, but they're going to come back through a process."
83	0	(APPLAUSE)
84	0	"Senator Cruz, what's wrong with letting what Mr. Trump calls, ""the good ones"" come back to the United States?"
85	0	"You know, the people that get forgotten in this debate over immigration are the hardworking men and women of this country -- our millions of Americans who are losing their jobs."
86	0	Millions of legal immigrants who are losing their jobs are seeing their wages driven down.
87	0	"You know, in the past couple of weeks the Wall Street Journal had a very interesting article about the state of Arizona."
88	1	"Arizona put in very tough laws on illegal immigration, and the result was illegal immigrants fled the state, and what's happened there -- it was a very interesting article."
89	0	"Some of the business owners complained that the wages they had to pay workers went up, and from their perspective that was a bad thing."
90	1	"But, what the state of Arizona has seen is the dollars they're spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars."
91	0	"And, the Americans, and for that matter, the legal immigrants who are in Arizona, are seeing unemployment drop are seeing wages rise."
92	0	That's who we need to be fighting for.
93	0	"Listen, we have always welcomed legal immigrants, but I think it is a mistake to forgive those who break the law to allow them to become U.S. citizens, and that's why I've led the fight against granting citizenship to those here illegally, and that's why I will do the same thing as president."
94	0	(APPLAUSE)
95	0	"Mr. Trump, do you want to respond to that?"
96	0	"Well, I'm very glad that Ted mentioned Arizona because probably the toughest man on borders is Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and two days ago he totally endorsed me, so, thank you."
97	0	(APPLAUSE)
98	0	Senator Rubio?
99	0	"Senator Cruz has called your immigration plan amnesty, and has an add out there comparing it to President Obama's."
100	0	"He says both of you support allowing undocumented immigrants legal status here in the United States after a background check, paying a fine, and paying taxes."
101	0	Are those claims correct?
102	0	"Well, first of all, and before we do anything, I've been abundantly clear on this."
103	0	"When I'm president of the United States, before we do anything on immigration, we are going to secure the border."
104	0	"And, that's not just the physical border with Mexico, it's Visa overstays."
105	0	That's 45 percent of the problem right there.
106	0	"It also has to do -- that's why we need e-verify, and entry-exit tracking system, and so-forth."
107	0	"And, until that happens, we're not doing anything else."
108	0	And then we'll see what the American people are willing to support.
109	0	"And Donald mentioned, because he mentioned me in his answer, that his position on immigration is what has driven this debate."
110	0	"Well, the truth is, though, that a lot of these positions that he's now taking are new to him."
111	0	"In 2011, he talked about the need for a pathway to citizenship."
112	0	"In 2012, Donald criticized Mitt Romney, saying that Mitt lost his election because of self-deportation."
113	0	"And so even today, we saw a report in one of the newspapers that Donald, you've hired a significant number of people from other countries to take jobs that Americans could have filled."
114	0	"My mom and dad -- my mom was a maid at a hotel, and instead of hiring an American like her, you have brought in over a thousand people from all over the world to fill those jobs instead."
115	0	So I think this is an important issue.
116	0	"And I think we are realizing increasingly that it's an important issue for the country that has been debated for 30 years, but finally needs to be solved once and for all."
117	0	Mr. Trump?
118	0	"Well, first of all, self-deportation is people are going to leave as soon as they see others going out."
119	0	"If you look at Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, they started moving people out and the rest of them left."
120	0	"Self-deportation, as I really define it, and that's the way I define it, is you're going to get some to go, and the rest are going to go out."
121	0	"As far as the people that I've hired in various parts of Florida during the absolute prime season, like Palm Beach and other locations, you could not get help."
122	0	It's the up season.
123	0	People didn't want to have part-time jobs.
124	0	"There were part-time jobs, very seasonal, 90-day jobs, 120-day jobs, and you couldn't get."
125	0	Everybody agrees with me on that.
126	0	They were part-time jobs.
127	0	"You needed them, or we just might as well close the doors, because you couldn't get help in those hot, hot sections of Florida."
128	0	That -- my point that I made was you had criticized Mitt Romney for self-deportation.
129	0	You said that his strategy of self- deportation is why he lost the election.
130	0	"And I think people in Florida would be surprised, because, in fact, the article that was today, they interviewed a number of people that would have been willing to do those jobs, if you would have been willing to hire them to do it."
131	0	I criticized Mitt Romney for losing the election.
132	0	He should have won that election.
133	0	He had a failed president.
134	0	He ran a terrible campaign.
135	0	He was a terrible candidate.
136	0	"That's what I criticize Mitt Romney -- I mean, ran..."
137	0	"No, he..."
138	0	Excuse me.
139	0	He ran one terrible campaign.
140	0	That's an election that should have been won.
141	0	(APPLAUSE)
142	0	"Well, in fact, I agree we should have won and I wished we would have, but, in fact, you did criticize him for using the term ""self-deportation."""
143	0	"I mean, that's on the record and people can look it up right now online."
144	0	"But, again, I just want to reiterate, I think it's really important, this point."
145	0	"I think it's fine, it's an important point that you raise and we discuss on immigration."
146	0	"This is a big issue for Texas, a huge issue for the country."
147	1	"But I also think that if you're going to claim that you're the only one that lifted this into the campaign, that you acknowledge that, for example, you're only person on this stage that has ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally."
148	1	You hired some workers from Poland...
149	0	"No, no, I'm the only one on the stage that's hired people."
150	0	You haven't hired anybody.
151	0	(APPLAUSE)
152	0	"In fact, some of the people..."
153	0	(CROSSTALK)
154	0	"And by the way, I've hired -- and by the way, I've hired tens of thousands of people over at my job."
155	0	You've hired nobody.
156	0	"Yes, you've hired a thousand from another country..."
157	0	"You've had nothing but problems with your credit cards, et cetera."
158	0	So don't tell me about that.
159	0	Let me just say -- let me finish the statement.
160	0	This is important.
161	0	"You haven't hired one person, you liar."
162	1	He hired workers from Poland.
163	1	And he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment from...
164	1	That's wrong.
165	1	That's wrong.
166	1	Totally wrong.
167	1	That's a fact.
168	0	People can look it up.
169	0	I'm sure people are Googling it right now.
170	0	Look it up.
171	1	"Trump Polish workers, you'll see a million dollars for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects."
172	1	He did it.
173	0	(APPLAUSE)
174	1	That happened.
175	0	I've hired tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
176	0	Tens of thousands...
177	0	Many from other countries instead of hiring Americans.
178	0	Be quiet.
179	0	Just be quiet.
180	0	(APPLAUSE)
181	0	Let me talk.
182	0	I've hired tens of thousands of people.
183	0	"He brings up something from 30 years ago, it worked out very well."
184	0	Everybody was happy.
185	1	You paid a million dollars.
186	0	"And by the way, the laws were totally different."
187	0	That was a whole different world.
188	0	Thank you.
189	0	But I've hired people.
190	0	Nobody up here has hired anybody.
191	0	(APPLAUSE)
192	0	"Senator Cruz, you say you want to deport the 11 million undocumented immigrants, but you never want to allow them to come back to the United States."
193	0	What would happen to the children who are U.S.- born citizens whose parent will be deported under your plan?
194	0	"Well, existing law provides that those who are deported cannot come back here legally."
195	0	U.S. citizens can come back.
196	0	That's existing law.
197	0	"But let me say, Wolf, I really find it amazing that Donald believes that he is the one who discovered the issue of illegal immigration."
198	0	"I can tell you, when I ran for Senate here in the state of Texas, I ran promising to lead the fight against amnesty, promising to fight to build a wall."
199	0	"And in 2013, when I was fight against the ""gang of eight"" amnesty bill, where was Donald?"
200	0	"He was firing Dennis Rodman on ""Celebrity Apprentice."""
201	0	(LAUGHTER)
202	0	"And indeed, if you look at the ""gang of eight,"" one individual on this stage broke his promise to the men and women who elected him and wrote the amnesty bill."
203	1	"If you look at the eight members of the Gang of Eight, Donald gave over $50,000 to three Democrats and two Republicans."
204	0	"And when you're funding open border politicians, you shouldn't be surprised when they fight for open borders."
205	0	"And I think if you want to know who actually will secure the borders and follow through, you ought to ask who has a record before they were a candidate for president of fighting to secure the borders and stop amnesty."
206	0	And I'm the only one on this stage that has that record.
207	1	"And by the way, Marco is exactly right that a federal court found Donald guilty of being part of a conspiracy to hire people illegally and entered a $1 million judgment against him."
208	0	(APPLAUSE)
209	0	Mr. Trump?
210	0	"I can only say this, and I've said it loud and clear and I've said it for years."
211	0	"And many of these people are sitting right in the audience right now -- your lobbyist and your special interest and your donors, because the audience is packed with them, and they're packed with you."
212	0	"I've had an amazing relationship with politicians -- with politicians both Democrat, Republican, because I was a businessman."
213	0	"As one magazine said, he's a world-class businessman; he was friendly with everybody."
214	0	I got along with everybody.
215	0	You get along with nobody.
216	0	"You don't have one Republican -- you don't have one Republican senator, and you work with them every day of your life, although you skipped a lot of time."
217	0	These are minor details.
218	0	But you don't have one Republican senator backing you; not one.
219	0	You don't have the endorsement of one Republican senator and you work with these people.
220	0	You should be ashamed of yourself.
221	0	(APPLAUSE)
222	0	Senator Cruz?
223	0	"You know, I actually think Donald is right."
224	0	He is promising if he's elected he will go and cut deals in Washington.
225	0	And he's right.
226	0	He has supported -- he has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats.
227	0	Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn't be hiring illegal immigrants.
228	0	Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn't be funding Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi; wouldn't be funding the Gang of Eight.
229	0	"And, you know, he is right."
230	0	"When you stand up to Washington, when you honor the promise you made to the men and women who elected you and say enough with the corruption, enough with the cronyism, let's actually stand for the working men and women of this country, Washington doesn't like it."
231	0	"And Donald, if you want to be liked in Washington, that's not a good attribute for a president."
232	0	(APPLAUSE)
233	0	(CROSSTALK)
234	0	Here's a man -- Robin Hood.
235	0	This is Robin Hood over here.
236	0	He talks about corruption.
237	0	"On his financial disclosure form, he didn't even put that he's borrowed money from Citibank and from Goldman Sachs, which is a total violation."
238	0	He didn't talk about the fact that he pays almost no interest.
239	0	"He just left it off, and now he's going to protect the people from the big bad banks."
240	0	Give me a break.
241	0	All right.
242	0	We're going to move on to Governor Kasich.
243	0	Governor Kasich...
244	0	(CROSSTALK)
245	0	"Wolf, can I respond to that attack?"
246	0	"You can respond, but let me get Governor Kasich in."
247	0	He's been waiting patiently.
248	0	"Governor Kasich, the idea -- you've said this, and I want to quote you now ""The idea that we're going to deport all these people is ludicrous and everybody knows it."""
249	0	Those are your words.
250	0	Should people be allowed to break the law just because it's not feasible to stop them?
251	0	"Look, we have a great president here, George Bush, the 41st president of the United States."
252	0	He worked with Ronald Reagan to pass an effort to try to solve this problem -- a path to legalization.
253	0	"You see, that was a time when things worked."
254	0	It was a time when President Reagan and George Bush decided that we needed to make the country work.
255	0	"Look, I think there is an answer here."
256	0	The answer is you complete the border.
257	0	"You let people know that once it's done, you don't have a right to come in."
258	0	"If you come in, we don't want any excuse."
259	0	You're going to go back.
260	0	But I favor a guest worker program.
261	0	I think it's practical.
262	0	"And I think for the 11 million or 11.5 million Americans -- the illegals that are here, if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, I'd make them pay a fine, some back taxes, maybe some community service."
263	0	"And at the end, I'd give them a path to legalization, but not a path to citizenship."
264	0	I don't think we're going to tear families apart.
265	0	I don't think we're going to ride around in people's neighborhoods and grab people out of their homes.
266	0	"I don't think -- first of all, I don't think it's practical and I don't think it reflects America."
267	0	You know what happened?
268	0	The problem with President Reagan is we didn't get in there and actually finish the border.
269	0	And I think it was probably business interests that affected it.
270	0	"But at the end of the day, let's be practical."
271	0	Let's start solving problems in this country instead of kicking them upstairs.
272	0	"With President Reagan and George Bush, it was a bipartisan coalition to address the issue, and I think we can and should do it again."
273	0	And I will have a plan in the first 100 days to get it done and get this issue behind us.
274	0	(APPLAUSE)
275	0	"Thank you, Governor."
276	0	(APPLAUSE)
277	0	"Dr. Carson, you've been critical of mass deportation."
278	0	You said back in November you don't think Mr. Trump's plan necessarily represents the Republican Party.
279	0	"Given how well Mr. Trump has been doing with the Republican primary voters, do you still believe that?"
280	0	I believe in liberty and justice for all.
281	0	I think everything that we do should be fair.
282	0	"And I've already described -- you know, how we can secure the border."
283	0	"We need to secure all the borders, because it's not just people coming in from South America and Mexico, but there are terrorists who want to destroy us, who are getting across our borders fairly easily."
284	0	And we have to stop that.
285	0	"But in terms of the people who are here already, after we -- after we stop the illegal immigration, we need to be reasonable."
286	0	"And I would give them a six-month period in which to get registered as a guest worker, assuming that they have an acceptable record."
287	0	"They have to pay a back-tax penalty, have to pay taxes going forward, but they don't have to live underground anymore."
288	0	"And I think they do not become American citizens, they do not vote."
289	0	"If they want to become an American citizen, they go through exactly the same process that anybody else goes through."
290	0	I think that's the kind of situation that is actually fair to people.
291	0	" And we have other ways of -- of utilizing our facilities and our talents as foreign aid doing things in South America and Central America and Mexico that improve the economy there, so that they don't feel the need to come over here."
292	0	"That would cost us a lot less than borrowing money from China, paying interest on it."
293	0	"Thank you, Dr. Carson."
294	0	(APPLAUSE)
295	0	"Mr. Trump, your campaign, as you well remember, began with the idea of building a wall along the southern border."
296	0	(inaudible).
297	0	It's about 315 miles southwest of where we are right now.
298	0	You've said the Mexican government will pay for it.
299	0	Correct.
300	0	The spokesperson for the current president of Mexico says that will never happen.
301	0	The last two presidents of Mexico say that will never happen.
302	0	"In fact, the former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox -- he said today, and I'm quoting him -- he said, ""I'm not going to pay for that,"" quote, ""effing wall."""
303	0	(LAUGHTER)
304	0	"So if you don't get an actual check from the Mexican government for $8 billion or $10 billion or $12 billion, whatever it will cost, how are you going to make them pay for the wall?"
305	0	"I will, and the wall just got 10 feet taller, believe me."
306	0	(APPLAUSE)
307	0	It just got 10 feet taller.
308	0	I saw him make that -- I saw him make the statement.
309	0	I saw him use the word that he used.
310	0	"I can only tell you, if I would have used even half of that word, it would have been national scandal."
311	0	"This guy used a filthy, disgusting word on television, and he should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize, OK?"
312	0	Number one.
313	0	"Number two, we have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year."
314	0	And that doesn't include all the drugs that are pouring across and destroying our country.
315	0	We're going to make them pay for that wall.
316	0	"Now, the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion, if I do it."
317	0	"If these guys do it, it'll end up costing $200 billion."
318	0	(APPLAUSE)
319	0	But the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion.
320	0	"You need 1,000 -- you need 1,000 miles."
321	0	"The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago -- 2,000, is 13,000 miles."
322	0	"We need 1,000, because we have a lot of natural barriers."
323	0	"We can do it for $10 billion to $12 billion, and it's a real wall."
324	0	This is a wall that's a heck of a lot higher than the ceiling you're looking at.
325	0	This is a wall that's going to work.
326	0	"Mexico will pay for it, because they are not doing us any favors."
327	0	They could stop all of this illegal trade if they wanted to...
328	0	(BELL RINGS)
329	0	... immediately.
330	0	Mexico will pay for the wall.
331	0	It's a small portion of the kind of money that we lose and the deficits that we have with Mexico.
332	0	(APPLAUSE)
333	0	"If the -- if the Mexicans don't pay for the wall, will you start a trade war with Mexico?"
334	0	"Well, you know, I don't mind trade wars when we're losing $58 billion a year, you want to know the truth."
335	0	We're losing so much.
336	0	(APPLAUSE)
337	0	"We're losing so much with Mexico and China -- with China, we're losing $500 billion a year."
338	0	"And then people say, ""don't we want to trade?"""
339	0	"I don't mind trading, but I don't want to lose $500 billion."
340	0	I don't want to lose $58 billion.
341	0	"Mexico just took Carrier Corporation, maker of air conditioners."
342	0	They just took Ford.
343	0	They're building a $2.5 billion plant.
344	0	They just took Nabisco out of Chicago.
345	0	"And I always say I'm not having Oreos anymore, which is true, by the way."
346	0	But they just took a big plant from Nabisco into Mexico.
347	0	They're taking our businesses.
348	0	I don't mind.
349	0	Thank you.
350	0	Senator Rubio?
351	0	(APPLAUSE)
352	0	"Yeah, a couple points."
353	0	"If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers, he'll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it."
354	0	The second...
355	0	(APPLAUSE)
356	0	Such a cute sound bite.
357	0	"But it -- no, it's not a sound bite."
358	0	It's a fact.
359	0	"Again, go online and Google it."
360	0	"Donald Trump, Polish workers."
361	0	You'll see it.
362	0	"The second thing, about the trade war -- I don't understand, because your ties and the clothes you make is made in Mexico and in China."
363	0	So you're gonna be starting a trade war against your own ties and your own suits.
364	0	"All right, you know what?"
365	0	Why don't you make them in America?
366	0	Because they devalue their currency -- they devalue their currencies...
367	0	"Well, then make them in America."
368	0	"... that makes it -- well, you don't know a thing about business."
369	0	You lose on everything...
370	0	"Well, make them in America."
371	0	Let me just tell you -- they de-value their currency.
372	0	They de-value their currencies.
373	0	"Well then, make them in America."
374	0	"That makes it -- well, you don't know a thing about business."
375	0	You lose on everything you do.
376	0	"Well, make them in America."
377	0	"Let me just tell you, they de-value their currencies."
378	0	"China, Mexico, everybody."
379	0	Japan with the cars.
380	0	"They de-value their currencies to such an extent that our businesses cannot compete with them, our workers lose their jobs..."
381	0	And so you make them in China and in Russia.
382	0	But you wouldn't know anything about it because you're a lousy businessman.
383	0	"Well, I don't know anything about bankrupting four companies."
384	0	You've bankrupted..
385	0	"No, I -- and you know why?"
386	0	You know why?
387	0	(APPLAUSE)
388	0	I don't know anything about...
389	0	You know why?
390	0	"... starting a university, and that was a fake university."
391	0	One at a time.
392	0	First of all...
393	0	One at a time.
394	0	"... first of all, that's called a..."
395	0	"There are people who borrowed $36,000..."
396	0	Hold on.
397	0	"One at a time, Mr. Trump."
398	0	"... to go to Trump University, and they're suing now -- $36,000 to go to a university..."
399	0	And by the way -- and by the way...
400	0	... that's a fake school.
401	0	... and by the way...
402	0	And you know what they got?
403	0	They got to take a picture with a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump...
404	0	I've won most of the lawsuits.
405	0	"That's what they got for $36,000."
406	0	"All right, I want to move on."
407	0	"And they actually did a very good job, but I've won most of the lawsuits."
408	0	"Mr. Trump, Senator, I want to bring in..."
409	0	Most of the lawsuits.
410	0	I want to bring in my colleague Maria Celeste.
411	0	Excuse me.
412	0	"Hey Wolf, let me ask you."
413	0	Am I allowed to respond to this?
414	0	You're allowed -- you've been responding.
415	0	"OK. Well let -- no, I haven't."
416	0	I really haven't.
417	0	(LAUGHTER)
418	0	He's talked through the whole thing.
419	0	(APPLAUSE)
420	0	"Here's a guy -- here's a guy that buys a house for $179,000, he sells it to a lobbyist who's probably here for $380,000 and then legislation is passed."
421	0	You tell me about this guy.
422	0	This is what we're going to have as president.
423	0	Here's a guy that inherited $200 million.
424	0	"If he hadn't inherited $200 million, you know where Donald Trump would be right now?"
425	0	"No, no, no."
426	0	Selling watches in (inaudible)
427	0	(APPLAUSE)
428	0	(Inaudible) I took...
429	0	That's where he would be.
430	0	That is so wrong.
431	0	We'll work on that.
432	0	I took $1 million and I turned into $10 billion.
433	0	"Oh, OK. One million."
434	0	I borrowed $1 million...
435	0	Better release your tax returns so we can see how much money he made.
436	0	"I borrowed $1 million, I turned it into $10 billion..."
437	0	"Oh, he doesn't make that money."
438	0	... more than $10 billion.
439	0	Thank you.
440	0	Thank you.
441	0	I want to bring in Maria Celeste of Telemundo.
442	0	Maria?
443	0	"Senator Rubio, last week, you said that on your first day in office, you will get rid of President Obama's executive action known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA for short."
444	0	Correct.
445	0	"It is a program that has protected hundreds of thousands of young people that came here when they were children, brought to the U.S. by undocumented immigrants."
446	0	"This is the only home they know, and that is a dramatic change from last April when you said in Spanish, and I'm going to quote you (in Spanish) which translates to DACA is going to have to end at some point, but it wouldn't be fair to cancel it immediately."
447	0	"So Senator Rubio, what changed?"
448	0	It didn't change.
449	0	Why is it now fair to cancel it on Day One?
450	0	"No, it's the same policy."
451	0	"It will have to end at some moment, and as I said, we will -- we will eliminate that executive order."
452	0	"The people that are on it now will not be allowed to renew it, and new applicants will not be allowed to apply to it."
453	0	And it's not because we're not compassionate to the plight of a 2 -- someone who came here when they were 2 years old.
454	0	I understand.
455	0	I know people that are personally impacted by this.
456	0	The problem with the executive order is it is unconstitutional.
457	0	The president doesn't have the power to do that.
458	0	(APPLAUSE)
459	0	And he himself admitted that.
460	0	"Senator, Senator..."
461	0	"I'm sorry, but let me finish my..."
462	0	... but you went -- you went from saying that it was deeply disruptive to deport them immediately to deport them on Day One.
463	0	"No, but this is not about deportation."
464	0	Everybody always goes immediately to the issue of deportation.
465	0	This is about DACA.
466	0	DACA is an executive order that is unconstitutional.
467	0	"I will cancel it on my first day in office, which means people who currently hold those permits will not be allowed to renew them when they expire, and new people will not be allowed to apply for them."
468	0	"Now, I am sympathetic to the plight of someone who came here when they were 2 or 3 years old through no fault of their own, but you can't solve it doing something that is unconstitutional."
469	0	"No matter how sympathetic we may be to a cause, we cannot violate the Constitution of the United States the way this president now does on a regular basis."
470	0	(APPLAUSE)
471	0	"Senator Rubio, you accused Senator Cruz in a previous debate of lying when he said that you said one thing in Spanish and another one in English."
472	0	So in what sense did he lie?
473	0	Because it is not true that I'm not going to get rid of DACA.
474	0	I am going to get rid of DACA.
475	0	"In the Spanish interview, you just read out the transcript in Spanish, I said, it will have to end at some point."
476	0	That point will be when I eliminate the executive order and the people who have those permits when they expire will not be allowed to renew it.
477	0	And new people will not be able to apply.
478	0	"In fact, I don't even think we should be taking new enrollees in the program now."
479	0	"That is how the program ends and how you wind it down is you allow the people who are on it, when the program expires, they cannot renew it, and it goes away."
480	0	But I will cancel the executive order as soon as I take -- as soon as I step foot into the Oval Office.
481	0	"I have to say, he lied this time."
482	0	He lied.
483	0	100 percent.
484	0	100 percent.
485	0	You lied about the Polish workers.
486	0	"Yes, yes, yes."
487	0	38 years ago.
488	0	You lied to the students at Trump University.
489	0	Let Senator Cruz jump in.
490	0	"Oh, he lied 38 years ago."
491	0	"All right, I guess there's a statute of limitation on lies."
492	0	(LAUGHTER)
493	0	(APPLAUSE)
494	0	"Well Maria, I would note you made the exact same point here that I made at the last debate, and you're right that Senator Rubio called me a liar for saying that."
495	0	"You know, we've both seen at home when Washington politicians say about an illegal, or unconstitutional program."
496	0	"Well, it'll have to end some day, not immediately, but someday in the future."
497	0	"That, inevitably, is when a politician doesn't plan to end it at all."
498	0	"You know, I'm reminded of that that is the same position that Marco took in Iowa on ethanol subsidies."
499	0	"When I campaigned in Iowa, I took on the lobbyists, took on the corporate welfare and said we should have no ethanol subsidies."
500	0	Marco's position was the same as it is to illegal amnesty.
501	0	"Well, someday it should end, just not now."
502	0	"And, frankly, I think we need a president who knows what he believes in, is willing to say it on day one, not at the end of his term when it's somebody else's problem."
503	0	That's not an accurate assessment of what I said about ethanol.
504	0	"What I said is that ethanol will phase out, it is phasing out now."
505	0	"By 2022 that program expires by virtue of the existing law, and at that point it will go away."
506	0	"I don't agree with the mandate and the program that's in place, but I think it's unfair that these people have gone out and invested all this money into this program and we're just going to yank it away from them."
507	0	"And, again, you read the statement in Spanish."
508	0	"I said very clearly on Spanish television, DACA will have to end at some point, and that point is -- at that time I was not a candidate for president."
509	0	"I said it will end in my first day in office as president, and the people who have it now will not be able to renew it."
510	0	New applicants will not be able to apply.
511	0	That is the end of DACA.
512	0	"I am sympathetic to this cause, but once again, it cannot supersede the Constitution of the United States which this president habitually and routinely every single day ignores and violates."
513	0	(CHEERING)
514	0	(APPLAUSE)
515	0	"Senator Cruz, you and Senator Rubio are the two candidates of hispanic descent on this stage."
516	0	"As a matter of fact, you are the first hispanic candidate ever to win a caucus or primary."
517	0	(APPLAUSE)
518	0	"And yet, there is the perception in the Latino community that instead of trying to prove to Latinos who has the best plan, the best platform to help them, that you two are spending the time arguing with each other."
519	0	Trying to figure out which one is tougher on immigration in order to appeal to the majority of Republicans.
520	0	"So, my question to you is are you missing a huge opportunity to expand the Republican base?"
521	0	"Well, Maria, you are right."
522	0	It is extraordinary that of five people standing on this stage that two of us are the children of Cuban immigrants.
523	0	It really is the embodiment of the incredible opportunity and promise this nation provides.
524	0	"You know, I would note that a lot of folks in the media have a definition of hispanics that you can only be hispanic if you're liberal."
525	0	"That makes sense in the media, but I gotta tell you, one of the things I was most proud of when I ran for Senate here in Texas, I earned 40 percent of the hispanic vote here in Texas."
526	0	"At the same time, Mitt Romney was getting clobbered with 27 percent of the hispanic vote nationwide."
527	0	"And, the reason is, as you know, you look at the value sin the hispanic community."
528	0	"The values in our community are faith, family, patriotism."
529	0	"You know, we've got the highest rate of military enlistment among hispanics in any demographic in this country."
530	0	"And, when I campaigned, and I campaigned the same here in Houston or Dallas as I did in the Rio Grande Valley, defending conservative principles, defending judeo- Christian principals, telling my father's story."
531	0	"Telling my Dad's story of coming to America with $100 dollars in his underwear, not speaking English, washing dishes, having hopes and dreams for the American dream."
532	0	"And, the truth is the Obama-Clinton economy has done enormous damage to the hispanic community."
533	0	"It is not working in the hispanic community, and I..."
534	0	(BELL RINGING)
535	0	... fighting so that everyone who is struggling in the hispanic community and beyond will have a fair and even shake at the American dream.
536	0	I'm sorry I was mentioned...
537	0	Governor Kasich.
538	0	Maria I was mentioned in that.
539	0	I was mentioned in that statement.
540	0	"Governor Kasich, after the..."
541	0	... OK.
542	0	I was mentioned -- just because of the hispanic -- and I'll be brief.
543	0	"A couple points, number one, I do think it's amazing that on this stage tonight there are two descendants of Cuban origin, and an African American."
544	0	"We are the party of diversity, not the Democratic party."
545	0	(APPLAUSE)
546	0	(CHEERING)
547	0	"And, the second point I would make is that we have to move past this idea that somehow the hispanic community only cares about immigration."
548	0	"Yes, it's an important issue because we know and love people that have been impacted by it."
549	0	"But, I'm going to tell you that the most powerful sentiment in the hispanic community, as it is in every immigrant community, is the burning desire to leave your children better off than yourself..."
550	0	(BELL RINGING)
551	0	"... and, you can only do that through free enterprise."
552	0	"That's what we stand for, not socialism like Bernie Sanders, and increasingly Hillary Clinton."
553	0	(APPLAUSE)
554	0	"Governor Kasich, after the last presidential election the Republican party realized that in order to win the presidency it needed the support of latinos."
555	0	"Guidelines as to how to accomplish that were spelled out in an autopsy (ph) report that concluded, and I'm going to quote it, ""if hispanic Americans hear that the GOP doesn't want them in the United States they won't pay attention to our next sentence."""
556	0	"So, do you think that your fellow Republican candidates get it?"
557	0	"Well, I'm not going to talk about that."
558	0	"I mean, I've got to tell you, I was with this little 12-year-old girl, was at a town hall meeting, and she said, you know, I don't like all this yelling and screaming at the debates."
559	0	My mother's thinking I might not be able to watch the thing anymore.
560	0	"I think we ought to move beyond that, about what they think."
561	0	I'm going to tell you what I think.
562	0	My position on this whole immigration issue has been clear from the beginning.
563	0	I haven't changed anything with it.
564	0	"And, look, my view is, we need economic growth."
565	0	Everything starts with economic growth.
566	0	And how do you get it?
567	0	"Common sense regulations, lower taxes for both business and individuals, and, of course, a fiscal plan that balances the budget."
568	0	That gives you economic growth.
569	0	"I did it when I was in Washington, as the Budget Committee chairman, negotiating actually with Democrats, that gave us surpluses, economic growth, and the same thing in Ohio."
570	0	But here's the thing that I believe.
571	0	Economic growth is not an end unto itself.
572	0	We have to make sure that everybody has a sense that they can rise.
573	0	"Of course, our friends in the Hispanic community, our friends in the African-American community, the promise of America is that our system, when we follow the right formula, is going to give opportunity for everyone."
574	0	It's what Jack Kemp used to say.
575	0	"A rising tide lifts all boats, not just some boats, but all boats."
576	0	And you know what?
577	0	"With me and the Hispanic community, I think they like me."
578	0	"And I appreciate that, because I want them to have the same opportunity that I and my children and my wife and the people we love have had in this country."
579	0	It's time to solve problems.
580	0	(APPLAUSE)
581	0	"Dr. Carson, concerning this recommendation of the report, are you, as a candidate, getting it?"
582	0	I didn't hear the first part of the question?
583	0	"The first part of the question is, there was a report that recommended that in order to approach Hispanics and bring them to vote for the Republican Party, certain things needed to happen."
584	0	"And one of them was that they shouldn't feel like they were going to get kicked out of the United States, otherwise they wouldn't pay attention to one more sentence from candidates."
585	0	"OK, well, first of all, let me just mention that last year at the NALEO, the National Association for Latino Elected Officials, I was the only one of 17 Republican candidates to go there."
586	0	And the reason that I don't fear going to an organization like that is because the message that I give is the same message to every group.
587	0	"You know, this is America."
588	0	And we need to have policies that are -- that give liberty and justice to all people.
589	0	"And that's the way that I have fashioned virtually every policy, looking at that."
590	0	And I think that's the way the Republican Party generally thinks.
591	0	We don't pick and choose winners and losers.
592	0	We are compassionate.
593	0	But real compassion is providing people with a ladder of opportunity to climb up from a state of dependence and become part of the fabric of America.
594	0	"When we begin to emphasize that, I think we will attract everybody."
595	0	(APPLAUSE)
596	0	"Mr. Trump, it is common knowledge that the Hispanic vote is very important in this race."
597	0	You keep saying that Hispanics love you.
598	0	True.
599	0	(LAUGHTER)
600	0	"And, yes, you won the Hispanic vote in Nevada."
601	0	True.
602	0	But a brand new Telemundo poll says that three out of four Hispanics that vote nationwide have a negative opinion of you.
603	0	They don't like you.
604	0	Wouldn't that make you an unelectable...
605	0	No.
606	0	... candidate in a general election?
607	0	"First of all, I don't believe anything Telemundo says."
608	0	You used to say that you love...
609	0	(LAUGHTER)
610	0	Number one.
611	0	"Number two, I currently employ thousands of Hispanics, and over the years, I've employed tens of thousands of Hispanics."
612	0	They're incredible people.
613	0	"They know, and the reason I won in Nevada, not only won the big one, but I also won subs, like, as an example, I won with women."
614	0	I won with every single category.
615	0	"I won with men, I won with high-income, low-income, I won with Hispanics."
616	0	And I got 46 percent.
617	0	Nobody else was close.
618	0	"Because they know I'm going to bring jobs back from China, from Japan, from so many other places."
619	0	They get it.
620	0	They're incredible people.
621	0	They're incredible workers.
622	0	They get it.
623	0	And I've won many of the polls with Hispanics.
624	0	I didn't maybe win the Telemundo poll.
625	0	"But one thing I'm also going to do, I'm going to be getting -- bringing a lot of people in who are Democrats, who are independents, and you're seeing that with the polls, because if you look at anywhere, look at any of the elections, every single election, it has been record-setting."
626	0	"And the good news is, for the Republican Party, the Democrats are getting very poor numbers in terms of bringing them in."
627	0	We're getting record-setting numbers.
628	0	I think I have something to do with that.
629	0	We're getting record-setting numbers.
630	0	"And I won every one -- the three of them that I won, I won with record-setting numbers."
631	0	New people are coming into the Republican Party.
632	0	"We are building a new Republican Party, a lot of new people are coming in."
633	0	(APPLAUSE)
634	0	"For the record, you have said publicly that you loved Telemundo in the past."
635	0	But it is not just a Telemundo poll.
636	0	We have...
637	0	I love them.
638	0	I love them.
639	0	(APPLAUSE)
640	0	All right.
641	0	"Well, it's not the only poll."
642	0	They're fine.
643	0	Do you know what?
644	0	They're fine.
645	0	"Just last night -- let me -- let me finish, please."
646	0	"Just last night, The Washington Post showed that 80 percent of Hispanic voters in their polls have a negative view of you."
647	0	"And concerning the Nevada victory, allow me to explain that the poll in Nevada was based on a tiny sample, statistically insignificant of only about 100 -- let me finish please -- of 100 Hispanic Republicans in the state of Nevada."
648	0	Why did they take the poll?
649	0	Why did they...
650	0	(CROSSTALK)
651	0	I am making reference -- I am making reference to Hispanic voters nationwide in a general election.
652	0	"I'm just telling you, I'm doing very well with Hispanics."
653	0	"And by the way, I settled my suit, as you know, with Univision."
654	0	It was settled.
655	0	We're good friends now.
656	0	It was all settled up.
657	0	(LAUGHTER)
658	0	"Very happy, very happy."
659	0	Very good people.
660	0	I'm just telling you -- I'm just telling you that I will do really well with Hispanics.
661	0	I will do better than anybody on this stage.
662	0	"I have respect for the people on the stage, but I will do very well with Hispanics."
663	0	"But I'm telling you also, I'm bringing people, Democrats over and I'm bringing independents over, and we're building a much bigger, much stronger Republican Party."
664	0	"Mr. Trump, thank you."
665	0	"I want to turn our attention now to another critically important issue for the American people, the United States Supreme Court, where filling the vacancy left by the late Justice Antonin Scalia has become a major campaign issue."
666	0	"I want to bring in Salem Radio Network host, Hugh Hewitt."
667	0	Hugh?
668	0	"Thank you, Wolf."
669	0	"To me, it's the most important issue."
670	0	"I'll start with you, Senator Cruz."
671	0	Do you trust Mr. Trump to nominate conservative justices?
672	0	"Well, Hugh, I agree with you that it -- Justice Scalia's passing underscores the enormous gravity of this election."
673	0	Justice Scalia was someone I knew personally for 20 years; was privileged to be at his funeral this weekend.
674	0	"And with his passing, the court is now hanging in the balance."
675	0	We are one liberal justice away from a five-justice radical leftist majority that would undermine our religious liberty; that would undermine the right to life; and that would fundamentally erase the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms from the Constitution.
676	0	"Now, I think the voters of Texas, the voters across Super Tuesday are assessing everyone standing on this -- this stage."
677	0	"In the past, Republican presidents always promise to nominate strict constitutionalists."
678	0	"So I'm certain if you took a survey, everyone would say they would do that."
679	0	"But the reality is, Democrats bat about 1,000."
680	0	Just about everyone they put on the court votes exactly as they want.
681	0	"Republicans have batted worse than 500, more than half of the people we put on the court have been a disaster."
682	0	"I've spent my whole life fighting to defend the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. I can tell you, for voters that care about life or marriage or religious liberty or the Second Amendment, they're asking the question ""Who do you know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, who do you know will nominate principled constitutionalists to the court?"""
683	0	"I give you my word, every justice I nominate will vigorously defend the Bill of Rights for my children and for yours."
684	0	(APPLAUSE)
685	0	"Mr. Trump, Senator Cruz mentioned the issue that keeps me up at night, which is religious liberty."
686	0	"Churches, Catholic and Christian colleges, Catholic adoption agencies -- all sorts of religious institutions fear that Hobby Lobby, if it's repealed, it was a five-four decision, they're going to have to bend their knee and provide morning-after pills."
687	0	"They fear that if Bob Jones is expanded, they will lose their tax exemption."
688	0	"Will you commit to voters tonight that religious liberty will be an absolute litmus test for anyone you appoint, not just to the Supreme Court, but to all courts?"
689	0	"Yes, I would."
690	0	And I've been there.
691	0	And I've been there very strongly.
692	0	"I do have to say something, and this is interesting and it's not anybody's fault."
693	0	It's not Ted's fault.
694	0	Justice Roberts was strongly recommended and pushed by Ted.
695	0	Justice Roberts gave us Obamacare.
696	0	Might as well be called Roberts-care.
697	0	"Two times of the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts approved something that he should have never raised his hand to approve."
698	0	And we ended up with Obamacare.
699	0	That is a rough thing.
700	0	And I know Ted feels badly about it.
701	0	And I think he probably still respects the judge.
702	0	But that judge has been a disaster in terms of everything we stand for because there is no way -- no way that he should have approved Obamacare.
703	0	"Now, with that being said, these are the things that happen."
704	0	"But Ted very, very strongly pushed Judge Roberts, and Justice Roberts gave us something that we don't want."
705	0	"Ted Cruz, Senator, the chief justice got Hobby Lobby right, but what do you make of Mr. Cruz's criticism?"
706	0	"Well, listen -- Donald knows that it was George W. Bush who appointed John Roberts."
707	0	"Yes, it's true, I supported the Republican nominee once he was made."
708	0	But I would not have nominated John Roberts.
709	0	"I would have nominated my former boss, Mike Luttig, who was the strongest proven conservative on the court of appeals."
710	0	"And I'll tell you, Hugh..."
711	0	(APPLAUSE)
712	0	"... you know, it's interesting now that Donald promises that he will appoint justices who -- who will defend religious liberty, but this is a man who, for 40 years, has given money to Jimmy Carter, to Joe Biden, to Hillary Clinton, to Chuck Schumer, to Harry Reid."
713	0	Nobody who supports far-left liberal Democrats who are fighting for judicial activists can possibly care about having principled constitutionalists on the court.
714	0	And what Donald has told us is he will go to Washington...
715	0	(BELL RINGS)
716	0	... and cut a deal.
717	0	Mr. Trump...
718	0	So that means on Supreme Court...
719	0	... can I...
720	0	"... he's going to look to cut a deal, rather than fight for someone who won't cut a deal on the Constitution, but will defend it faithfully."
721	0	(APPLAUSE)
722	0	Can I trust you on religious liberty?
723	0	"Well, let -- let me -- let me just say -- let me just say this."
724	0	"Look, I watched Ted -- and I respected it, but he gets nowhere -- stand on the Senate floor for a day or two days, and talk and talk and talk."
725	0	I watched the other senators laughing and smiling.
726	0	"And when Ted was totally exhausted, he left the Senate floor, and they went back to work."
727	0	OK?
728	0	We have to have somebody that's going to make deals.
729	0	It's wonderful to stand up for two days and do that.
730	0	"Now, Ted's been very critical -- I have a sister who's a brilliant..."
731	0	"Mr. Cruz, will you make a deal about religious liberty?"
732	0	... excuse me.
733	0	She's a brilliant judge.
734	0	He's been criticizing -- he's been criticizing my sister for signing a certain bill.
735	0	You know who else signed that bill?
736	0	"Justice Samuel Alito, a very conservative member of the Supreme Court, with my sister, signed that bill."
737	0	So I think that maybe we should get a little bit of an apology from Ted.
738	0	What do you think?
739	0	Let me -- Senator.
740	0	"Let me tell you right now, Donald, I will not apologize for a minute for defending the Constitution."
741	0	I will not apologize for defending the Bill of Rights.
742	0	(APPLAUSE)
743	0	"And I find it amazing that your answer to Hugh and to the American people is, on religious liberty, you can't have one of the these crazy zealots that actually believes in it."
744	0	You've got to be willing to cut a deal.
745	1	"And you know, there is a reason why, when Harry Reid was asked, of all the people on this stage, who does he want the most, who does he like the most, Harry Reid said Donald -- Donald Trump."
746	0	Why?
747	1	"Because Donald has supported him in the past, and he knows he can cut a deal with him."
748	0	(BELL RINGS)
749	0	"You know what, Donald..."
750	0	(CROSSTALK)
751	0	Senator Rubio.
752	0	"I don't want a Supreme Court justice that you cut a deal with Harry Reid to undermine religious liberty, because that same justice will also erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights."
753	0	(APPLAUSE)
754	0	"When you say crazy zealot, are you talking about you?"
755	0	Crazy zealot -- give me a break.
756	0	"Senator Rubio, you've heard this exchange on religious liberty."
757	0	"You have said that religious liberty will trump even the ability of people to stay away from same-sex marriages, not provide flowers, not provide baked goods, et cetera."
758	0	Are you satisfied with this exchange on religious liberty?
759	0	"Well, I think you ask a very important question, because the issue here -- the next president of the United States has to fill this vacancy."
760	0	"Justice Scalia -- in the history of the republic, there has never been anyone better than him at standing for the principle that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document -- it is supposed to be applied as originally meant."
761	0	And the next president of the United States has to be someone that you can trust and believe in to appoint someone just as good as Scalia -- plus there may be at least two other vacancies.
762	0	"So you ask Mr. Trump to respond and say that he would, and he says that he would."
763	0	"But the bottom line is, if you look at his record over the last 25 or 30 years, on issue after issue, he has not been on our side."
764	0	"Now, if he's changed, we're always looking for converts into the conservative movement."
765	0	"But the bottom line is that, if (ph) you don't have a record there to look at and say, ""I feel at peace that when Donald Trump is president of the United States, he's going to be firmly on our side on these issues."""
766	0	"In fact, very recently, he was still defending Planned Parenthood."
767	0	He says he's not going to take sides in the Palestinians versus Israel.
768	0	These are concerning things.
769	0	"And so, yes, I have a doubt about whether Donald Trump, if he becomes president, will replace Justice Scalia with someone just like Justice Scalia."
770	0	Mr. Trump?
771	0	(APPLAUSE)
772	0	"Well, let -- let me just say -- let me just say, first of all, I have great respect for Justice Scalia."
773	0	I thought he was terrific.
774	0	"And if you talk about evolving, Ronald Reagan was a somewhat liberal Democrat."
775	0	"Ronald Reagan evolved into a somewhat strong conservative -- more importantly, he was a great president."
776	0	A great president.
777	0	"As far as Planned Parenthood is concerned, I'm pro-life."
778	0	"I'm totally against abortion, having to do with Planned Parenthood."
779	0	"But millions and millions of women -- cervical cancer, breast cancer -- are helped by Planned Parenthood."
780	0	"So you can say whatever you want, but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatly."
781	0	And I wouldn't fund it.
782	0	"I would defund it because of the abortion factor, which they say is 3 percent."
783	0	I don't know what percentage it is.
784	0	They say it's 3 percent.
785	0	"But I would defund it, because I'm pro-life."
786	0	But millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood.
787	0	(APPLAUSE)
788	0	"Governor Kasich, back to religious liberty."
789	0	You've been a little bit less emphatic.
790	0	"You've said, same-sex couple approaches a cupcake maker, sell them a cupcake."
791	0	Can we trust you as much on religious liberty as the rest of these people?
792	0	"Well, you know, of course."
793	0	"I mean, if -- look, I was involved in just being a pioneer in a new church."
794	0	Religious institutions should be able to practice the religion that they believe in.
795	0	No question and no doubt about it.
796	0	"Now, in regard to same-sex marriage, I don't favor it."
797	0	"I've always favored traditional marriage, but, look, the court has ruled and I've moved on."
798	0	"And what I've said, Hugh, is that, look, where does it end?"
799	0	"If you're in the business of selling things, if you're not going to sell to somebody you don't agree with, OK, today I'm not going to sell to somebody who's gay, and tomorrow maybe I won't sell to somebody who's divorced."
800	0	"I mean, if you're in the business of commerce, conduct commerce."
801	0	That's my view.
802	0	"And if you don't agree with their lifestyle, say a prayer for them when they leave and hope they change their behavior."
803	0	"But when it comes to the religious institutions, they are in inviolate in my mind, and I would fight for those religious institutions."
804	0	"And look, I've appointed over a hundred judges as governor."
805	0	I even appointed adjudge to the Ohio Supreme Court.
806	0	And you know what they are?
807	0	They're conservatives.
808	0	Go check it out.
809	0	They are conservatives.
810	0	They don't make the law.
811	0	They interpret the law.
812	0	That's all they do.
813	0	And they stick by the Constitution.
814	0	So I will do that.
815	0	But let's just not get so narrow here as to gotcha this or that.
816	0	I think my position is clear.
817	0	"Dr. Carson, let me wrap it up with you."
818	0	Are their positions clear?
819	0	(APPLAUSE)
820	0	Are the positions you've heard clear about the First Amendment and the first freedom?
821	0	"Well, first of all, let me just add my praise to Justice Scalia."
822	0	I first met him when we got an honorary degree together a long time ago.
823	0	A tremendous wit and intellect.
824	0	"As far as religious freedom is concerned, one of the basic tenets of this nation, and I believe that the Constitution protects all of our rights."
825	0	And it gives people who believe in same-sex marriage the same rights as everybody else.
826	0	"But what we have to remember is even though everybody has the same rights, nobody get extra rights."
827	0	So nobody gets to redefine things for everybody else and then have them have to conform to it.
828	0	That's unfair.
829	0	And this is the responsibility of Congress to come back and correct what the Supreme Court has done.
830	0	That's why we have divided government.
831	0	"And we're going to have to encourage them to act in an appropriate way, or we will lose our religious freedom."
832	0	"And as president, I would go through and I would look at what a person's life has been."
833	0	What have they done in the past?
834	0	What kind of judgments have they made?
835	0	What kind of associations do they have?
836	0	That will tell you a lot more than an interview will tell you.
837	0	The fruit salad of their life is what I will look at.
838	0	"Thank you, Dr. Carson."
839	0	(APPLAUSE)
840	0	"All of you want to repeal and replace Obamacare, so let's talk about your plans, specific plans to replace it."
841	0	"I want to bring in our chief political correspondent, Dana Bash."
842	0	"Senator Rubio, you said yesterday, right here in Houston, that Mr. Trump thinks part of Obamacare is pretty good."
843	0	"So, he says he is going to repeal Obamacare."
844	0	Are you saying that you're worried he won't?
845	0	The individual mandate.
846	0	"He said he likes the individual mandate portion of it, which I don't believe that should be part of it."
847	0	That should not remain there.
848	0	I think here's what we need to replace it with.
849	0	We need to repeal Obamacare completely and replace it with a system that puts Americans in charge of their health care money again.
850	0	"If your employer wants to buy health insurance for you, they can continue to do so from any company in America they want to buy it from."
851	0	"Otherwise, your employers can provide you health care money, tax- free, not treated as income, and you can use that money only for health care, but you can use it to fund health care any way you want, fully fund a health savings account, the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country."
852	0	"And if you don't have that, then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage."
853	0	"And that, I think, is a much better approach than Obamacare, which, by the way, isn't just bad for health care, it's bad for our economy."
854	0	"It is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people's hours, move people to part-time."
855	0	"It is not just a bad health care law, it is a job-killing law."
856	0	And I will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all Americans.
857	0	(APPLAUSE)
858	0	"Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio just said that you support the individual mandate."
859	0	Would you respond?
860	0	"I just want to say, I agree with that 100 percent, except pre-existing conditions, I would absolutely get rid of Obamacare."
861	0	"We're going to have something much better, but pre-existing conditions, when I'm referring to that, and I was referring to that very strongly on the show with Anderson Cooper, I want to keep pre- existing conditions."
862	0	I think we need it.
863	0	I think it's a modern age.
864	0	And I think we have to have it.
865	0	(APPLAUSE)
866	0	"OK, so let's talk about pre-existing conditions."
867	0	What the insurance companies say is that the only way that they can cover people is to have a mandate requiring everybody purchase health insurance.
868	0	Are they wrong?
869	0	I think they're wrong 100 percent.
870	0	"What we need -- look, the insurance companies take care of the politicians."
871	0	The insurance companies get what they want.
872	0	We should have gotten rid of the lines around each state so we can have real competition.
873	0	"We thought that was gone, we thought those lines were going to be gone, so something happened at the last moment where Obamacare got approved, and all of that was thrown out the window."
874	0	"The reason is some of the people in the audience are insurance people, and insurance lobbyists, and special interests."
875	0	"They got -- I'm not going to point to these gentlemen, of course, they're part of the problem, other than Ben, in all fairness."
876	0	"And, actually, the Governor too, let's just talk about these too, OK?"
877	0	(LAUGHTER)
878	0	Because I don't think the Governor had too much to do with this.
879	0	"But, we should have gotten rid of the borders, we should have gotten rid of the lines around the state so there's great competition."
880	0	The insurance companies are making a fortune on every single thing they do.
881	1	I'm self-funding my campaign.
882	1	I'm the only one in either party self-funding my campaign.
883	0	I'm going to do what's right.
884	0	"We have to get rid of the lines around the states so that there's serious, serious competition."
885	0	"But, Mr. Trump..."
886	0	"... And, you're going to see -- excuse me."
887	0	"You're going to see preexisting conditions and everything else be part of it, but the price will be done, and the insurance companies can pay."
888	0	Right now they're making a fortune.
889	0	(APPLAUSE)
890	0	"But, just to be specific here, what you're saying is getting rid of the barriers between states, that is going to solve the problem..."
891	0	That's going to solve the problem.
892	0	"And, the insurance companies aren't going to say that, they want to keep it."
893	0	They want to say -- they say whatever they have to say to keep it the way it is.
894	0	"I know the insurance companies, they're friends of mine."
895	0	"The top guys, they're friends of mine."
896	0	"I shouldn't tell you guys, you'll say it's terrible, I have a conflict of interest."
897	0	"They're friends of mine, there's some right in the audience."
898	0	"One of them was just waving to me, he was laughing and smiling."
899	0	He's not laughing so much anymore.
900	0	Hi.
901	0	(APPLAUSE)
902	0	"Look, the insurance companies are making an absolute fortune."
903	0	"Yes, they will keep preexisting conditions, and that would be a great thing."
904	0	"Get rid of Obamacare, we'll come up with new plans."
905	0	"But, we should keep preexisting conditions."
906	0	"Dana, I was mentioned in his response, so if I may about the insurance companies..."
907	0	... Go ahead.
908	0	"You may not be aware of this, Donald, because you don't follow this stuff very closely, but here's what happened."
909	0	When they passed Obamacare they put a bailout fund in Obamacare.
910	0	"All these lobbyists you keep talking about, they put a bailout fund in the law that would allow public money to be used, taxpayer money, to bail out companies when they lost money."
911	0	"And, we led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund."
912	0	"The insurance companies are not in favor of me, they hate that."
913	0	They're suing that now to get that bailout money put back in.
914	0	"Here's what you didn't hear in that answer, and this is important guys, this is an important thing."
915	0	What is your plan?
916	0	"I understand the lines around the state, whatever that means."
917	0	This is not a game where you draw maps...
918	0	"... And, you don't know what it means..."
919	0	"... What is your plan, Mr. Trump?"
920	0	(APPLAUSE)
921	0	What is your plan on healthcare?
922	0	You don't know.
923	0	(inaudible)
924	0	The biggest problem...
925	0	(CROSSTALK)
926	0	... What's your plan...
927	0	"The biggest problem, I'll have you know..."
928	0	... What's your plan...
929	0	"... You know, I watched him meltdown two weeks ago with Chris Christie."
930	0	"I got to tell you, the biggest problem he's got is he really doesn't know about the lines."
931	0	"The biggest thing we've got, and the reason we've got no competition, is because we have lines around the state, and you have essentially...."
932	0	"... We already mentioned that (inaudible) plan, I know what that is, but what else is part of your plan..."
933	0	... You don't know much...
934	0	"So, you're only thing is to get rid of the lines around the states."
935	0	What else is part of your healthcare plan...
936	0	The lines around the states...
937	0	... That's your only plan...
938	0	"... and, it was almost done -- not now..."
939	0	"... Alright, (inaudible)..."
940	0	Excuse me.
941	0	Excuse me.
942	0	... His plan.
943	0	That was the plan...
944	0	"... You get rid of the lines, it brings in competition."
945	0	"So, instead of having one insurance company taking care of New York, or Texas, you'll have many."
946	0	"They'll compete, and it'll be a beautiful thing."
947	0	Alright...
948	0	(APPLAUSE)
949	0	"So, that's the only part of the plan?"
950	0	Just the lines?
951	0	(inaudible)
952	0	The nice part of the plan -- you'll have many different plans.
953	0	"You'll have competition, you'll have so many different plans."
954	0	Now he's repeating himself.
955	0	"No, no, no."
956	0	(LAUGHTER)
957	0	(APPLAUSE)
958	0	(CHEERING)
959	0	(inaudible)
960	0	(inaudible)
961	0	(CHEERING)
962	0	(inaudible) I watched him repeat himself five times four weeks ago...
963	0	I just watched you repeat yourself five times five seconds ago...
964	0	(APPLAUSE)
965	0	"I watched him meltdown on the stage like that, I've never seen it in anybody..."
966	0	... Let's stay focused on the subject...
967	0	I thought he came out of the swimming pool...
968	0	"I see him repeat himself every night, he says five things, everyone's dumb, he's gonna make America great again..."
969	0	Senator Rubio...
970	0	"... We're going to win, win win, he's winning in the polls..."
971	0	"Senator Rubio, please."
972	0	... And the lines around the state.
973	0	(APPLAUSE)
974	0	... Every night.
975	0	Senator Rubio.
976	0	(CHEERING)
977	0	"I tell the truth, I tell the truth."
978	0	"Senator Rubio, you will have time to respond if you would just let Mr. Trump respond to what you've just posed to him..."
979	0	"... Yeah, he's going to give us his plan now, right?"
980	0	OK...
981	0	If you could talk a little bit more about your plan.
982	0	I know you talked about...
983	0	... We're going to have many different plans because...
984	0	... Can you be a little specific...
985	0	... competition...
986	0	He's done it again.
987	0	(CHEERING)
988	0	(APPLAUSE)
989	0	"There is going to be competition among all of the states, and the insurance companies."
990	0	"They're going to have many, many different plans."
991	0	Is there anything else you would like to add to that...
992	0	"No, there's nothing to add."
993	0	(CHEERING)
994	0	(APPLAUSE)
995	0	What is to add?
996	0	Thank you.
997	0	Thank you both.
998	0	Alright.
999	0	"Governor Kasich, you've said it is, quote, ""Un American to deny someone health insurance if they have a preexisting condition."""
1000	0	Would you leave the individual mandate in place requiring all Americans to purchase insurance?
1001	0	"No, I wouldn't."
1002	0	And -- but that doesn't matter when it comes to the issue of preexisting conditions.
1003	0	"You don't want any American to lose their house, everything they've saved, because they get sick."
1004	0	"Now, I think it is more complicated than what we've heard here tonight."
1005	0	We're actually running significant health reform in my state.
1006	0	I would repeal Obamacare for a variety of reasons.
1007	0	"I would take some of the federal resources, combine it with the freed-up Medicaid program, which I would send back to the states, and cover the people who are currently the working poor because we don't want to have tens of millions of Americans losing their health insurance."
1008	0	And then we're driving towards total transparency.
1009	0	"If any of you here ever get a hospital bill, it's easier to interpret the Dead Sea scrolls than to understand your hospital bill."
1010	0	The fact is what we need is transparency with hospitals and with the providers.
1011	0	And I'll tell you what we will do.
1012	0	We are actually going to make payments to physicians and to hospitals who actually deliver healthcare with great quality at low prices.
1013	0	We actually are going to make the market work.
1014	0	"Governor, let me just go back to the original question about the individual mandate."
1015	0	"In 1994 when you were in Congress, you proposed a plan requiring an individual mandate."
1016	0	So what changed?
1017	0	"Well, Dana, the Heritage Foundation had this position as well."
1018	0	"And when I look at it, I don't think it's tenable."
1019	0	And we don't need to do that.
1020	0	"Again, I'm telling you that we are going to -- we have a proposal, a plan that we're enacting now that says if you are a hospital or a doctor and you're providing very high quality at lower prices, below the midpoint -- some charge high, some charge low."
1021	0	"If you are below the midpoint, we are going to give you a financial reward for allowing you to provide services that result in high quality for our people at lower pricess."
1022	0	That is the way in which we are going to damp down the rising costs of healthcare.
1023	0	"Because if you think about your own deductibles today, they're going higher, higher and higher."
1024	0	And you know what?
1025	0	"At some point, people can't afford it."
1026	0	Our plan will work.
1027	0	It uses the market.
1028	0	It uses transparency.
1029	0	It gets the patient in the middle.
1030	0	And guess what?
1031	0	"We're actually doing it in my state, the seventh-largest state in the country."
1032	0	"And if this will go -- this will go national, we will get our hands on healthcare where you will know what's going on."
1033	0	"We will pay for quality, lower prices, and we will begin to see healthcare become affordable in America and where people will also be able to have health insurance, even if they have a preexisting condition."
1034	0	"We don't want to throw millions of people out into the cold and not have the health insurance, Dana."
1035	0	So that's really what we're doing.
1036	0	This is not a theory.
1037	0	This is what we are actually doing in our state.
1038	0	We will begin payments next year based on episodes that we have in our lives.
1039	0	"If our primary care physicians keep us healthy for a year, with really high quality, guess what?"
1040	0	They will get a financial reward.
1041	0	Our primary care physicians need help.
1042	0	They need support.
1043	0	We're losing them.
1044	0	This will allow them to get a reward for doing a great job.
1045	0	"Governor Kasich, thank you."
1046	0	Thank you.
1047	0	(APPLAUSE)
1048	0	"Dr. Carson, you have dealt with the sickest of patients."
1049	0	You support covering preexisting conditions.
1050	0	"How would you change Obamacare, but maintain that coverage?"
1051	0	"Well, first of all, healthcare is not a right."
1052	0	"But I do believe it is a responsibility for a responsible society, and we are that."
1053	0	We spend almost twice as much per capita on healthcare as many other nations who have actually much better access than we do.
1054	0	"I propose a system in which we use health empowerment accounts, which are like a health savings account with no bureaucrats."
1055	0	And we give it to everybody from birth until death.
1056	0	They can pass it on when they die.
1057	0	We pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional healthcare with.
1058	0	We give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account within their family.
1059	0	"So dad's $500 short, mom can give it to him or a cousin or uncle."
1060	0	And it makes every family their own insurance carrier with no middle man.
1061	0	It gives you enormous flexibility.
1062	0	"And also, you know, if Uncle Joe is smoking like a chimney, everybody's going to hide his cigarettes because they're all interested in what's going on there."
1063	0	"Also, the -- your catastrophic healthcare is going to cost a lot less money now because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic healthcare."
1064	0	"So, it's like a homeowners policy with a large deductible, versus a homeowners policy where you want every scratch covered."
1065	0	"One costs $1,500 a year; one costs $10,000 a year."
1066	0	"You can buy the $1,500 one."
1067	0	That will take care of 75 percent of the people.
1068	0	"The people who are indigent, how do we take care of them now?"
1069	0	Medicaid.
1070	0	What's the Medicaid budget?
1071	0	"Almost $500 billion; almost 80 million people participate, which is way too many, and that will get a lot better when we fix the economy, which I hope we get a chance to talk about."
1072	0	But do the math.
1073	0	"Over $5,000 for each man, woman and child, and all -- they will have a lot more flexibility."
1074	0	What could you buy with that?
1075	0	A concierge practice.
1076	0	Thank you.
1077	0	And you could still have thousands of dollars left over.
1078	0	"And let me just finish, because I don't get to talk that much."
1079	0	"And, you know, let's..."
1080	0	(APPLAUSE)
1081	0	... you can have the money that's left over to buy your catastrophic insurance.
1082	0	"But most importantly, we give them a menu, just like we do in Medicare Part C, and they have the choices that will allow them not only to have catastrophic health care, but drug care and everything else."
1083	0	"It will be such a good program that nobody will want Obamacare after that, and that's probably the best way do it, although if anybody still did, I would still de-fund it."
1084	0	Thank you.
1085	0	(APPLAUSE)
1086	0	"Thank you, Dr. Carson."
1087	0	Let's talk about the economy.
1088	0	Let's talk about...
1089	0	"Wolf, Wolf, Wolf."
1090	0	Does everyone get to address Obamacare but me?
1091	0	"I want to move on, but there'll be plenty of opportunities for you to address..."
1092	0	It's kind of an issue I have a long history with.
1093	0	I know you do.
1094	0	"And -- all right, go ahead."
1095	0	(LAUGHTER)
1096	0	"Thank you, Wolf."
1097	0	"How do you -- how do you get that extra time, Cruz?"
1098	0	You're very good at...
1099	0	"You know, this is another issue on which Donald and I have sharp disagreements."
1100	0	"On Planned Parenthood, he thinks Planned Parenthood is wonderful."
1101	0	I would instruct the Department of Justice to investigate them and prosecute any and all criminal violations.
1102	0	(APPLAUSE)
1103	0	"On Obamacare, both Donald and I say we want to end it, but for very different reasons."
1104	1	"I want to end it because it goes too far, it's killed millions of jobs, and it's hurting people's health care."
1105	0	Donald wants to end it because he says it doesn't go nearly far enough.
1106	0	And what was amazing in that exchange that was missing is for decades Donald has been advocating socialized medicine.
1107	0	"What he's said is government should pay for everyone's health care, and in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said, if you don't support socialized health care, you're heartless."
1108	0	"Now, liberal Democrats have been saying that for years."
1109	0	"Now let me tell you if you're a small business owner, Donald Trump's socialized medicine, putting the government in charge of your health care would kill more jobs than Obamacare, and if you're elderly, the results of socialized medicine in every country on earth where it's been implemented has been rationing, has been the government saying, no, you don't get that hip replacement, you don't get that knee replacement, the government is in charge of your health care."
1110	0	I'll tell you this.
1111	0	As president...
1112	0	Senator...
1113	0	I will repeal every word of Obamacare.
1114	0	(APPLAUSE)
1115	0	"Thank you, thank you."
1116	0	Mr. Trump?
1117	0	"I do not want socialized medicine, just so you understand."
1118	0	"He goes around saying oh, he wants it."
1119	0	I do not want socialized medicine.
1120	0	"I do agree with him that it's going to be a disaster, Obamacare, for the economy."
1121	0	"In 2017, it will be impossible for us to pay for it if you look at what's going on."
1122	0	"That's why it has to be repealed, for a lot of reasons, Number one, it doesn't work, number two, premium."
1123	0	"You look at premiums going up, 25, 35, even 45 percent, and more."
1124	0	We have to get rid of Obamacare.
1125	0	It is going to destroy our economy completely.
1126	0	Our economy is not doing well.
1127	0	It is going to destroy our economy greatly.
1128	0	"And on that, I agree."
1129	0	"Donald, true or false, you've said the government should pay for everyone's health care."
1130	0	That's false.
1131	0	You've never said that?
1132	0	"No, I said it worked in a couple of countries..."
1133	0	But you've never stood on this debate stage and says it works great in Canada and Scotland and we should do it here.
1134	0	"No, I did not."
1135	0	No I did not.
1136	0	"Did you say if you want people to die on the streets, if you don't support socialized health care, you have no heart."
1137	0	Correct.
1138	0	I will not let people die on the streets if I'm president.
1139	0	Have you said you're a liberal on health care?
1140	0	Excuse me.
1141	0	Let me talk.
1142	0	If people...
1143	0	Talk away.
1144	0	"Explain your plan, please."
1145	0	If people -- my plan is very simple.
1146	0	"I will not -- we're going to have private -- we are going to have health care, but I will not allow people to die on the sidewalks and the streets of our country if I'm president."
1147	0	You may let it and you may be fine with it...
1148	0	So does the government pay for everyone's health care?
1149	0	I'm not fine with it.
1150	0	We are going to take those people...
1151	0	Yes or no.
1152	0	Just answer the question.
1153	0	Excuse me.
1154	0	We are going to take those people and those people are going to be serviced by doctors and hospitals.
1155	0	"We're going to make great deals on it, but we're not going to let them die in the streets."
1156	0	Who pays for it?
1157	0	"Well, can I just clarify something?"
1158	0	"Gentleman, please."
1159	0	"Wolf, no."
1160	0	I want to clarify something.
1161	0	Gentlemen please.
1162	0	I want to move on.
1163	0	"This is a Republican debate, right?"
1164	0	Because that attack about letting people die in the streets...
1165	0	I want to talk about the economy.
1166	0	(CROSSTALK)
1167	0	"Gentleman, gentleman."
1168	0	All of you have agreed -- Senator Cruz...
1169	0	You know what?
1170	0	Call it what you want.
1171	0	It's a yes or no.
1172	0	"Call it what you want, people are not going to be dying on the sidewalk."
1173	0	All of you have agreed -- all of you have agreed to the rules.
1174	0	I want to move on.
1175	0	We're talking about the economy right now.
1176	0	"Mr. Trump, you want to cut taxes more than President Ronald Reagan did, more than President George W. Bush did."
1177	0	"The Independent Tax Foundation says the cost to the country of your proposal would be about $10 trillion, and that takes into account the economic growth that would emerge from your proposed tax cuts."
1178	0	"How would you cut $10 trillion over 10 years, but make sure the country isn't saddled with even more debt?"
1179	0	Because the country will become a dynamic economy.
1180	0	We'll be dynamic again.
1181	1	"If you look at what's going on, we have the highest taxes anywhere in the world."
1182	1	"We pay more business tax, we pay more personal tax."
1183	1	We have the highest taxes in the world.
1184	0	It's shutting off our economy.
1185	0	It's shutting off our country.
1186	0	We have trillions of dollars outside that we can't get in.
1187	0	"Yes, we will do my tax plan, and it will be great."
1188	0	We will have a dynamic economy again.
1189	0	What specific cuts will you make to pay for that tax cut?
1190	0	We're going to make many cuts in business.
1191	0	We're getting rid of -- we're going to get rid of so many different things.
1192	0	Department of Education -- Common Core is out.
1193	0	We're going local.
1194	0	Have to go local.
1195	0	(APPLAUSE)
1196	0	Environmental protection -- we waste all of this money.
1197	0	We're going to bring that back to the states.
1198	0	And we're going to have other (inaudible) many things.
1199	0	(APPLAUSE)
1200	0	"We are going to cut many of the agencies, we will balance our budget, and we will be dynamic again."
1201	0	Mr. Trump -- Mr. Trump.
1202	0	"If you eliminate completely the Department of Education, as you have proposed, that's about $68 billion."
1203	0	"If you eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency, that's about $8 billion."
1204	0	That's about $76 billion for those two agencies.
1205	0	The current deficit this year is $544 billion.
1206	0	Where are you going to come up with the money?
1207	0	"Waste, fraud and abuse all over the place."
1208	0	"Waste, fraud and abuse."
1209	0	(APPLAUSE)
1210	0	"You look at what's happening with Social Security, you look -- look at what's happening with every agency -- waste, fraud and abuse."
1211	0	"We will cut so much, your head will spin."
1212	0	Governor Kasich.
1213	0	(APPLAUSE)
1214	0	"When you were in Congress, you were chairman of the Budget Committee."
1215	0	You helped craft the last balanced budget the United States had.
1216	0	Can Mr. Trump's plan work?
1217	0	"Well, I think it takes three things, Wolf."
1218	0	And I've done it.
1219	0	"I mean, I -- we got the budget balanced."
1220	0	We cut the capital gains tax.
1221	0	"You see, in order to get this economy moving again, you have to grow the economy, and you have to restrain the spending."
1222	0	"And when I was chairman, we cut that capital gains tax and we instituted a significant program to get to balance."
1223	0	"We had a balanced budget four years in a row, had to take on every interest group in Washington -- every single one of them -- and we paid down a half a trillion of the national debt."
1224	0	And why do you do it?
1225	0	Because you want job growth.
1226	0	"If you don't have regulatory reform, common-sense regulations, reasonable tax cuts, which I have, and a fiscal plan, you won't get there."
1227	0	You will never be able to do it.
1228	0	"Now, I -- I inherited an an $8 billion hole in Ohio, I have common-sense regulations, I have tax cuts -- the biggest of any governor in the country -- and we have a fiscal plan."
1229	0	And it's not all -- it's not always cutting.
1230	0	"It's innovating -- it's producing a better product at, frankly, a lower price."
1231	0	Now we have a $2 billion surplus.
1232	0	"Our credit is strong, our pensions are strong."
1233	0	"And, look -- I've got a plan to take to Washington, and I will have it there in the first hundred days, and it will include shifting welfare, education, transportation, Medicaid and job training back to us, so we can begin, in the states, to be the laboratories of innovation."
1234	0	I've done it -- I did it in Washington -- four years of balanced budgets.
1235	0	No one could even believe it happened.
1236	0	(BELL RINGS)
1237	0	"I've done it in Ohio, we're growing, the jobs are up and people are having opportunity."
1238	0	And I will go back to Washington and do it again for the American people.
1239	0	I promise you that.
1240	0	(APPLAUSE)
1241	0	"Within the first hundred days, we will have the plan to get this done."
1242	0	Thank you.
1243	0	"Thank you, governor."
1244	0	(APPLAUSE)
1245	0	Speaking of taxes...
1246	0	"I just want to say -- and I'm a big fan of the governor, but they also struck oil, OK, so that helped Iowa a lot."
1247	0	"OK, let me -- let me -- let me just talk about that, because I know that -- that Donald believes the energy industry is important."
1248	0	So do I.
1249	1	"But of the over 400,000 jobs that we've created in the state, we think maybe 15,000 are connected to this industry, because it's early-stage."
1250	0	"See, what we've done in Ohio, and what a president needs to do, is to have a cabinet and a whole operation that's jobs-friendly."
1251	0	We have diversified our economy.
1252	0	"We -- we do have energy, we have medical devices, we have financial services, we have I.T., we just got Amazon -- their Cloud computing in the Midwest."
1253	0	You know why it's happening?
1254	0	(BELL RINGS)
1255	0	"Because we're balanced budgets, we're strong, we're job-friendly, we don't raise their taxes, and if we have a president that does that in America, we will get the economic growth, and that is what this country needs."
1256	0	"Jobs, jobs and jobs, period."
1257	0	(APPLAUSE)
1258	0	"Mr. Trump, yesterday, the last Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, called on you to release your back tax returns, and said, and I'm quoting him now, ""there is good reason to believe there is a bombshell in them."""
1259	0	"Romney said either you're not as wealthy as you say you are, said maybe you haven't paid the kind of taxes we would expect you to pay, or you haven't been giving the money to veterans or disabled people."
1260	0	Are any of those accusations that he has leveled true?
1261	0	All right.
1262	0	"First of all, let me just explain."
1263	0	I was the first one to file a financial disclosure form -- almost 100 pages.
1264	0	You don't learn anything about somebody's wealth with a tax return.
1265	0	You learn it from statements.
1266	0	I filed -- which shows that I'm worth over $10 billion.
1267	0	I built a great company with very little debt.
1268	0	"People were shocked, the people in the back, the reporters, they were shocked when they went down."
1269	0	And I filed it on time.
1270	0	"I didn't ask for five 45-day extensions, which I would have been entitled to."
1271	0	"So as far as that's concerned, I filed it."
1272	0	And that's where you find out what kind of a company.
1273	0	You don't learn anything from a tax return.
1274	0	I will say this.
1275	0	Mitt Romney looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed.
1276	0	And Harry Reid baited him so beautifully.
1277	0	"And Mitt Romney didn't file his return until a September 21st of 2012, about a month-and-a-half before the election."
1278	0	And it cost him big league.
1279	0	"As far as my return, I want to file it, except for many years, I've been audited every year."
1280	0	"Twelve years, or something like that."
1281	0	"Every year they audit me, audit me, audit me."
1282	0	Nobody gets audited -- I have friends that are very wealthy people.
1283	0	They never get audited.
1284	0	I get audited every year.
1285	1	"I will absolutely give my return, but I'm being audited now for two or three years, so I can't do it until the audit is finished, obviously."
1286	0	And I think people would understand that.
1287	0	"Hugh, go ahead."
1288	0	Mr. Trump.
1289	0	You told me...
1290	0	Are you going to ask anybody else that question?
1291	0	"Yes, amen, amen."
1292	0	(LAUGHTER)
1293	0	Every single question comes to me?
1294	0	Mr. Trump...
1295	0	(CROSSTALK)
1296	0	"I know I'm here for the ratings, but it's a little bit ridiculous."
1297	0	(LAUGHTER)
1298	0	"Mr. Trump, a year ago you told me on my radio show, the audio and the transcript are out there on YouTube, that you would release your tax returns."
1299	0	True.
1300	0	Are you going back on your commitment?
1301	0	"No, I'm not."
1302	0	"First of all, very few people listen to your radio show."
1303	0	That's the good news.
1304	0	(LAUGHTER)
1305	0	"Let me just tell you, let me just -- which happens to be true."
1306	0	Check out the ratings.
1307	0	"Look, let me just tell you something."
1308	0	Let me just tell you something.
1309	0	I want to release my tax returns but I can't release it while I'm under an audit.
1310	0	We're under a routine audit.
1311	0	"I've had it for years, I get audited."
1312	0	"And obviously if I'm being audited, I'm not going to release a return."
1313	0	"As soon as the audit is done, I love it."
1314	0	"So, Senator Rubio, Mitt Romney also called upon to you release your tax returns."
1315	0	Your campaign said last spring that you would release your returns that you had not previously released.
1316	0	"And you said, coming out any day momentarily."
1317	0	When are we going to see your returns?
1318	0	"Yes, tomorrow or Saturday, in fact, is our plan to release them."
1319	0	And there's nothing really that interesting in them.
1320	0	So I have no problem releasing them.
1321	0	"And luckily I'm not being audited this year, or last year, for that matter."
1322	0	(CROSSTALK)
1323	0	But this is my time.
1324	0	I want to go back to this question you asked about the debt.
1325	0	This is an important issue.
1326	0	"It's a huge issue, OK?"
1327	0	"In less than five years, 83 percent of our entire budget will be made up of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the interest on the debt."
1328	0	That means only 17 percent of our budget will be for things like the military or the Department of Education or environmental protection issues.
1329	0	"You cannot balance our budget unless you deal with that 83 percent, which is why I've been repeatedly talking about since my time running for the Senate in Florida, where there are a lot of people like my mother that depend on Social Security and Medicare, on the need to save those programs, by reforming the way they work for future generations."
1330	0	"And I think if we -- the longer we take to do this, the closer we are going to get to a debt crisis."
1331	0	"And, Wolf, you did not get an answer to your question."
1332	0	This debt issue is -- the next president of the United States will not be able to serve four to eight years without dealing with the national debt.
1333	0	"It is not a question of if, it is a question of when we have a debt crisis."
1334	0	And we should not leave the stage here tonight without hearing a serious answer from every single one of us about how we are going to deal bring the national debt under control once and for all.
1335	0	"Thank you, Senator Rubio."
1336	0	But I am...
1337	0	(APPLAUSE)
1338	0	I'm being fair to all of the candidates.
1339	0	"Senator Cruz, Tuesday is five days away."
1340	0	"Why haven't voters seen your 2012, 2013, and 2014 returns?"
1341	0	"So, I've released five years of tax returns already."
1342	0	We will have two more years available tomorrow.
1343	0	"And I would note that this question really goes -- you know, Donald says he's being audited."
1344	0	"Well, I would think that would underscore the need to release those returns."
1345	0	"If he has said something that was false and that an audit is going to find was fraudulent, the voters need to know."
1346	0	"And listen, people across this country, we recognize our country is in crisis."
1347	0	"The most important question is how do we win the general election in November, 2016."
1348	0	And roughly 65 percent of Republicans think Donald is not the right candidate to go against Hillary Clinton.
1349	0	"Now, part of the reason in the last 10 polls..."
1350	0	"Eighty-five percent say you, big difference."
1351	1	... RealClearPolitics he has lost to Hillary on eight of them.
1352	1	"In the last 10 polls on RealClearPolitics, I either tied or beat Hillary."
1353	0	And this is an example.
1354	0	"You know, the mainstream media is laying off Donald now."
1355	0	They're going to pick apart his taxes.
1356	0	They're going to pick apart his business deals.
1357	0	"And let's take, for example, one of Hillary's great vulnerabilities, the corruption at the Clinton Foundation, the fact that she had CEOs and foreign companies giving her money while she was secretary of state."
1358	0	The next Republican nominee needs to be able to make that case against Hillary.
1359	0	"And if Donald tried to did it, Hillary would turn to Donald and say, ""but gosh, Donald, you gave $100,000 to the Clinton foundation. I even went to your wedding."""
1360	0	"He can't prosecute the case against Hillary, and we can't risk another four years of these failed Obama policies by nominating someone who loses to Hillary Clinton in November."
1361	0	(APPLAUSE)
1362	0	(CROSSTALK)
1363	0	"So at the beginning, I said openly to everybody that I contribute to many, many politicians, both Republican and Democrat."
1364	0	"And I have, over the years."
1365	0	I'm a businessman.
1366	0	"I have, over the years."
1367	0	And I sort of have to laugh when Ted makes a big deal out of the fact that he's doing well in the polls.
1368	0	"Well, I'm beating him in virtually every poll."
1369	0	"I'm tied in Texas, by the way, which I shouldn't be."
1370	0	But I think I'll do very well.
1371	0	(APPLAUSE)
1372	0	"But a poll just came out -- a Bloomberg poll -- where I am beating him so badly that it's, like, embarrassing even for me to say I'm beating him that badly."
1373	0	(APPLAUSE)
1374	0	"And -- and here's the thing -- it was sort of funny -- 65 percent of the people don't like you -- I just got 36 percent of the vote, right?"
1375	0	I just got 46 percent on another one.
1376	0	I got 38 percent...
1377	0	(BELL RINGS)
1378	0	... on another one.
1379	0	"That means -- and he got 20 and 22, and he lost in South Carolina so badly -- that was going to be his stronghold."
1380	0	"He said a year ago, ""I can't lose South Carolina."""
1381	0	I beat him in a landslide.
1382	0	"Last week in Nevada, I beat him in a landslide, and he sang (ph) about the polls."
1383	0	"One other thing -- Hillary Clinton -- take a look at USA Today, take a look at the Q poll."
1384	1	"I beat her, and I beat her badly."
1385	0	And I -- and I haven't even started at her.
1386	0	I only had one little interchange...
1387	0	(APPLAUSE)
1388	0	"I only had one little interchange, and that was..."
1389	0	(BELL RINGS)
1390	0	"... four weeks ago, when she said I was sexist."
1391	0	"And believe me, they had a rough weekend that weekend, between Bill and Hillary."
1392	0	They had a rough weekend.
1393	0	(APPLAUSE)
1394	0	Gentlemen.
1395	0	Gentlemen.
1396	0	Gentlemen.
1397	0	Hold on.
1398	0	"He -- he attacked me, Wolf."
1399	0	I get a response.
1400	0	"I was about to say -- Senator Cruz, respond."
1401	0	Thank you.
1402	0	Thank -- thank -- thank you very much.
1403	0	"You know, it's interesting -- Donald went -- went on -- on an extended tirade about the polls, but he didn't respond to any of the substance."
1404	0	He has yet to say -- he can release past year's tax returns.
1405	0	He can do it tomorrow.
1406	0	"He doesn't want to do it, because presumably there's something in there..."
1407	0	Nothing.
1408	0	... that is bad.
1409	0	"If there's nothing, release them tomorrow."
1410	0	(CROSSTALK)
1411	0	They're already prepared.
1412	0	The only reason he's not releasing them...
1413	0	You -- you don't...
1414	0	... is because he's afraid that he will get hit.
1415	0	I'm not afraid (inaudible).
1416	0	"You know, Marco made reference earlier to the litigation against Trump University."
1417	0	It's a fraud case.
1418	0	His lawyers have scheduled the trial for July.
1419	0	"I want you to think about, if this man is the nominee, having the Republican nominee..."
1420	0	(BELL RINGS)
1421	0	"... on the stand in court, being cross-examined about whether he committed fraud."
1422	0	You don't think the mainstream media will go crazy on that?
1423	0	"And on substance, how do we nominate a candidate who has said Hillary Clinton was the best secretary of state of modern times, who agreed with her on foreign policy, who agrees with Bernie Sanders on health care, who agreed with Barack Obama on the Wall Street bailout?"
1424	0	All right (ph)...
1425	0	"If -- we've got to win this election, and we can't do it with a candidate who agrees with Hillary Clinton and can't take it to her and beat her on the debate stage and at the polls."
1426	0	Mr. Trump.
1427	0	"Mr, -- hold on."
1428	0	Mr. Trump -- Mr. Trump...
1429	0	"... first of all, he's talking about the polls."
1430	0	I'm beating him awfully badly in the polls.
1431	0	(CROSSTALK)
1432	0	But you're not beating Hillary.
1433	0	You're not beating Hillary.
1434	0	"Well, then, if I can't -- if -- hey, if I can't beat her, you're really going to get killed, aren't you?"
1435	0	(APPLAUSE)
1436	0	"So -- so let me ask you this, because you're really getting beaten badly."
1437	0	"I know you're embarrassed -- I know you're embarrassed, but keep fighting -- keep swinging, man (ph)."
1438	0	Swing for the fences.
1439	0	"Let me just tell you -- let me just tell you, the Trump University case is a civil case."
1440	0	Not a -- it's a civil case.
1441	0	It's a case where people want to try and get -- it's a case that is nonsense.
1442	0	It's something I could have settled many times.
1443	0	"I could settle it right now for very little money, but I don't want to do it out of principle."
1444	0	"The people that took the course all signed -- most -- many -- many signed report cards saying it was fantastic, it was wonderful, it was beautiful."
1445	0	"As -- and believe me, I'll win that case."
1446	0	That's an easy case.
1447	0	Civil case.
1448	0	"Number two, as far as the taxes are concerned, I'm being audited."
1449	0	"It's a very routine audit, and it's very unfair, because I've been audited for, I think, over 12 years."
1450	0	"Every year, because of the size of my company, which is very, very large, I'm being audited -- which is a very large company."
1451	0	(BELL RINGS)
1452	0	Thank you.
1453	0	"I'm being audited 12 years in a row, at least."
1454	0	"Now, until that audit's done, and I don't think anybody would blame me, I'm not giving it..."
1455	0	(CROSSTALK)
1456	0	... the years you're not being audited?
1457	0	Will you release those years?
1458	0	"Gentlemen, gentlemen, thank you."
1459	0	(inaudible) audited for those years.
1460	0	Which years?
1461	0	Which years are you being audited?
1462	0	Gentlemen...
1463	0	(CROSSTALK)
1464	0	... we actually have rules -- we're trying to obey these rules that all of you agreed.
1465	0	We're going to take a quick break.
1466	0	We have a lot more -- many more critically important issues to discuss.
1467	0	Our coverage of this tenth Republican presidential debate from the University of Houston continues in a moment.
1468	0	(APPLAUSE)
1469	0	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
1470	0	Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate here at the University of Houston.
1471	0	"Gentlemen, I want to turn our attention right now to key issues involving foreign policy and national security."
1472	0	"And Mr. Trump, I'll begin with you."
1473	0	Shocking.
1474	0	(LAUGHTER)
1475	0	"You said this about the ongoing conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians -- I'm quoting you now: ""Let me be sort of a neutral guy. I don't want to say whose fault it is, I don't think it helps."""
1476	0	Right.
1477	0	Here's the question.
1478	0	How do you remain neutral when the U.S. considers Israel to be America's closest ally in the Middle East?
1479	0	"Well, first of all, I don't think they do under President Obama because I think he's treated Israel horribly, all right?"
1480	0	I think he's treated Israel horribly.
1481	0	(APPLAUSE)
1482	0	"I was the grand marshall down 5th Avenue a number of years ago for the Israeli Day Parade, I have very close ties to Israel."
1483	0	I've received the Tree of Life Award and many of the greatest awards given by Israel.
1484	0	"As president, however, there's nothing that I would rather do to bring peace to Israel and its neighbors generally."
1485	0	And I think it serves no purpose to say that you have a good guy and a bad guy.
1486	0	"Now, I may not be successful in doing it."
1487	0	It's probably the toughest negotiation anywhere in the world of any kind.
1488	0	OK?
1489	0	"But it doesn't help if I start saying, ""I am very pro-Israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage."""
1490	0	"But it doesn't do any good to start demeaning the neighbors, because I would love to do something with regard to negotiating peace, finally, for Israel and for their neighbors."
1491	0	"And I can't do that as well -- as a negotiator, I cannot do that as well if I'm taking big, big sides."
1492	0	"With that being said, I am totally pro-Israel."
1493	0	Senator Cruz?
1494	0	(APPLAUSE)
1495	0	"Well, this is another area on which Donald agrees with Hillary Clinton and on which I disagree with them both strongly."
1496	0	"Both Donald and Hillary Clinton want to be neutral, to use Donald's word, between Israel and the Palestinians."
1497	0	Let me be clear.
1498	0	"If I'm president, America will stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel."
1499	0	(APPLAUSE)
1500	0	And the notion of neutrality is based upon the left buying into this moral relativism that is often pitched in the media.
1501	0	"Listen, it is not equivalent."
1502	0	"When you have terrorist strapping dynamite around their chest, exploding and murdering innocent women and children, they are not equivalent to the IDF officers protecting Israel."
1503	0	And I will not pretend that they are.
1504	0	"Just today, Iran announced they're going to pay $7,000 to each suicide bomber."
1505	0	"And I would note, missing from Donald's answer was anything he has done in his nearly 70 years of living defending Israel."
1506	0	"I have over and over again led the fight to defend Israel, to fight for Israel."
1507	0	"And this -- if you want to know who will stand with Israel, we ought to start with who has stood with Israel when the heat was on."
1508	0	(APPLAUSE)
1509	0	Mr. Trump?
1510	0	"Well, I can only say -- look, I can only say I've been a big contributor to Israel over the years."
1511	0	"I've received many, many awards from Israel, as I've said before."
1512	0	I have a great relationship with Israel.
1513	0	And I'm going to keep it that way.
1514	0	"And if I could bring peace, that would be a fantastic thing."
1515	0	It would be one of my greatest achievements as president.
1516	0	"Governor Kasich, I want you to weigh in."
1517	0	"Well, I mean, well, I was in Congress for 18 years on the Defense Committee."
1518	0	"And then, you know, after 9/11, the secretary of defense called me in to help out with some things."
1519	0	And I've been a supporter of Israel -- a strong supporter of Israel longer than anybody on this stage.
1520	0	"I didn't give as much money as Donald gave, but I've been standing with the Israelis for a very long time."
1521	0	"And frankly, I think the problem we have in foreign policy right now, Wolf, is that we are not certain with who we stand with."
1522	0	"Our allies are not sure what to make of us, and our enemies are moving."
1523	0	And one -- are moving because they're not sure what we will do.
1524	0	It's a very interesting development here within the 24 hours.
1525	0	We said to the South Koreans that we would give them the high altitude defense system.
1526	0	"It really rattled the Chinese, and for the first time since we took positive action, the Chinese are beginning to take action against North Korea."
1527	0	"When we stand firm and we let the world know who we're with, who we stand for, and we bring our allies together, that is the road forward."
1528	0	(CROSSTALK)
1529	0	(APPLAUSE)
1530	0	We're going to get to North Korea in a moment.
1531	0	"But Senator Rubio, what's wrong with the U.S. being an honest broker in a negotiation, as Mr. Trump is proposing?"
1532	0	Because -- and I don't know if Donald realizes this.
1533	0	I'm sure it's not his intent perhaps.
1534	0	But the position you've taken is an anti-Israel position.
1535	0	And here's why.
1536	0	Because you cannot be an honest broker in a dispute between two sides in which one of the sides is constantly acting in bad faith.
1537	0	"The Palestinian Authority has walked away from multiple efforts to make peace, very generous offers from the Israels."
1538	0	"Instead, here's what the Palestinians do."
1539	0	They teach their four- year-old children that killing Jews is a glorious thing.
1540	0	Here's what Hamas does.
1541	0	They launch rockets and terrorist attacks again Israel on an ongoing basis.
1542	0	"The bottom line is, a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, given the current makeup of the Palestinians, is not possible."
1543	0	And so the next president of the United States needs to be someone like me who will stand firmly on the side of Israel.
1544	0	"I'm not -- I'm not going to sit here and say, ""Oh, I'm not on either side."""
1545	0	I will be on a side.
1546	0	"I will be on Israel's side every single day because they are the only pro-American, free enterprise democracy in the entire Middle East."
1547	0	(APPLAUSE)
1548	0	Mr. Trump?
1549	0	I'm a negotiator.
1550	0	I've done very well over the years through negotiation.
1551	0	It's very important that we do that.
1552	0	"In all fairness, Marco is not a negotiator."
1553	0	"I watched him melt down and I'll tell you, it was one of the saddest things I've ever seen."
1554	0	He's not going down -- excuse me...
1555	0	He thinks a Palestinian is a real estate deal.
1556	0	"... wait a minute, and these people may even be tougher than Chris Christie."
1557	0	OK?
1558	0	"The Palestinians are not a real estate deal, Donald."
1559	0	"OK, no, no, no -- a deal is a deal."
1560	0	Let me tell you that.
1561	0	I learned a long time ago.
1562	0	A deal is not a deal when you're dealing with terrorists.
1563	0	Have you ever negotiated with terrorists?
1564	0	You are not a negotiator.
1565	0	You are not a negotiator.
1566	0	(APPLAUSE)
1567	0	"And, with your thinking, you will never bring peace."
1568	0	You will never bring peace...
1569	0	"... Donald, might be able to (inaudible) Palestinians and Arabs, but it's not a real estate deal..."
1570	0	"Excuse me, I want to be able to bring peace..."
1571	0	Senator.
1572	0	He will never be able to do it.
1573	0	"I think I may be able to do it, although I will say this."
1574	0	Probably the toughest deal of any kind is that particular deal.
1575	0	Let's move on to talk about North Korea.
1576	0	"You raised it, Governor Kasich."
1577	0	"The threat posed by North Korea to the United States and its allies, the commander of American forces in South Korea said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would use a weapon of mass destruction if he thought his regime was being threatened."
1578	0	You have said the United States should start examining a strategy of regime change in North Korea.
1579	0	Let's be clear.
1580	0	Are you talking about getting rid of Kim Jong Un?
1581	0	"When you talk about regime change, Wolf, it means regime change."
1582	0	That's what it means.
1583	0	"Even though there's so much chaos in North Korea right now, there's a lot of reports of uncertainty, and instability in that government."
1584	0	"But, look, here's what I think we ought to do -- like, immediately."
1585	0	"And, we've been kicking the can down the road on this for, I don't know, 15 years."
1586	0	"We should be intercepting the ships that are leaving North Korea so they're not selling this material, or this technology, or giving it to someone else."
1587	0	"Secondly, the same goes with the aircraft."
1588	0	"Thirdly, we need to slap even tougher sanctions on North Korea because we really don't have the toughest sanctions on North Korea."
1589	0	We ought to talk about arming South Korea with ballistic missile technology.
1590	0	"And, of course, also Japan with ballistic missile technology."
1591	0	Because we're now starting to take a firm position.
1592	0	We have the attention of the Chinese.
1593	0	The Chinese are the best way to calm that regime down and get them in a position of where they back off.
1594	0	"But, when I say regime change, I don't have to talk exactly what that means."
1595	0	"Look, I've been involved in national security for a long time."
1596	0	"You don't have to spell everything out, but what I'm telling you is you look for any means you can to be able to solve that problem in North Korea, and in the meantime put the pressure on the Chinese."
1597	0	"And, what we're doing is beginning to work against them."
1598	0	They are the key to being able to settle this situation.
1599	0	"I just want to be precise, Governor Kasich, this is critically important."
1600	0	There are a million North Korean troops North of the DMZ...
1601	0	I'm very well aware of that.
1602	0	"A million South Korean troops, 28,000 U.S. troops along the DMZ, right in between."
1603	0	Would you risk war for a regime change?
1604	0	"Wolf, again, it would depend exactly what, you know, what was happening."
1605	0	What the situation was.
1606	0	"But, if there was an opportunity to remove the leader of North Korea and create stability?"
1607	0	"Because, I'll tell you, you keep kicking the can down the road we're going to face this sooner or later."
1608	0	"But, in the meantime, I'm also aware of the fact that there's 10 million people living in Seoul."
1609	0	"So, you don't just run around making charges."
1610	0	I have put it on the table that I would leave to see regime change in North Korea.
1611	0	"Now, perhaps the Chinese can actually accomplish that with this man who is now currently the leader, but the fact is we have to bring everything to bear."
1612	0	"We have to be firm, and we've got to unite those people in that part of the world to stand firmly against North Korea, and make sure we have the ballistic..."
1613	0	(BELL RINGING)
1614	0	... ballistic missile technology to defend ourselves.
1615	0	Mr. Trump.
1616	0	"One thing I'd like to add to what the Governor's saying, I think that we are now in a position -- are $19 trillion dollars because of the horrible omnibus budget that was approved six weeks ago, it's going to be $21 trillion dollars."
1617	0	"We can no longer defend all of these countries, Japan, Germany, South Korea."
1618	0	"You order televisions, you order almost anything, you're getting it from these countries."
1619	0	"Whether it's a Mercedes-Benz, or whether it's an air conditioning unit."
1620	0	They're coming out of these countries.
1621	0	They are making a fortune.
1622	0	"Saudi Arabia, we are defending Saudi Arabia."
1623	0	"Before the oil went down, now they're making less, but they're making plenty."
1624	0	They were making $1 billion dollars a day.
1625	0	(BELL RINGING)
1626	0	We defend all of these countries for peanuts.
1627	0	You talk about budgets.
1628	0	We have to start getting reimbursed for taking care of the military services for all of these countries.
1629	0	(APPLAUSE)
1630	0	"Hey, Wolf, Wolf..."
1631	0	Dr. Carson.
1632	0	"Hey, Wolf, let me just say this because he mentioned this."
1633	0	"Look, we're all in agreement that the Japanese need to do more."
1634	0	"We're all in agreement that the Europeans need to do more, but I hate to just tell everybody we are the leader of the world and we should put the pressure on them to do their job."
1635	0	There is no question about it.
1636	0	"But, at the same time, we also have to rebuild the military."
1637	0	"Look, I have a balanced budget plan that cuts taxes, reforms regulations, but also builds the military, puts a $100 billion dollars more in defense."
1638	0	"We need to rebuild our defenses,"
1639	0	"But, I must also tell you, a long time reformer of the Pentagon, we must reform that building."
1640	0	(BELL RINGING)
1641	0	We can't have a weapon system take 22 and a half years.
1642	0	"We have 800,000 bureaucrats working for DOD, performing bureaucratic functions when we ought to be putting..."
1643	0	Thank you...
1644	0	... these resources into strengthening the military.
1645	0	"So, we can do it all..."
1646	0	"Dr. Carson, how would you deal with North Korea?"
1647	0	"OK. Well first of all, people say that I whine a lot because I don't get time."
1648	0	"I'm going to whine because I didn't get asked about taxes, I didn't get asked about Israel."
1649	0	"Hugh, you said you're going to be fair to everybody, you didn't ask me about taxes."
1650	0	I had something to say about that.
1651	0	Now...
1652	0	Go ahead.
1653	0	This is your moment.
1654	0	(APPLAUSE)
1655	0	OK. We have a system of taxation in this country that is horribly wrong.
1656	0	"You know, I never had an audit until I spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast, and then all of a sudden, they came in, they said we just want to look at your real estate dealings."
1657	0	"And then they didn't find anything, so they said let's look at the whole year."
1658	0	"And they didn't find anything, so they said let's look at the next year and the next year."
1659	0	They didn't find anything and they won't find anything because I'm a very honest person.
1660	0	But he fact of the matter is the IRS is not honest and we need to get rid of them.
1661	0	(APPLAUSE)
1662	0	"And as far as Israel is concerned, you know, when I was there several months ago, I talked to a lot of people."
1663	0	I couldn't find a single one who didn't think that we had turned our backs on Israel.
1664	0	"You know, they are a strategic partner for us but also recognize that we have a Judeo Christian foundation, and the last thing we need to do is to reject Israel."
1665	0	It doesn't mean that we can't be fair to other people.
1666	0	"We can always be fair to other people, but, you know, it's like when you have a child, you know, you want to be fair to all the children around but you have a special attention for your own child."
1667	0	"And now, as far as North Korea is concerned, you know, Kim Jung Un is an unstable person, but he does understand strength."
1668	0	And I think we have to present strength to him.
1669	0	We should be encouraging the alliance with Japan and South Korea.
1670	0	"We should be encouraging the placement of the THAAD, the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, that seems to disturb not only the North Koreans but the Chinese as well."
1671	0	"And we also need to have a much more robust naval presence in that area, and I think we need to be developing strategic defense initiative because this man is going to have long-range missiles, he is going to have nuclear capabilities."
1672	0	We need to be able to defend ourselves.
1673	0	"And lastly, we should make sure that he knows that if he ever shoots a missile at us, it will be the last thing he ever does."
1674	0	(APPLAUSE)
1675	0	Thank you.
1676	0	Thank you.
1677	0	We're going to continue with national security.
1678	0	"Go ahead, Hugh."
1679	0	"Thank you, Wolf."
1680	0	"Mr. Trump, we are less than 24 hours away from a ceasefire in Syria that has been brokered between the U.S. and Russia."
1681	0	Do you support this ceasefire?
1682	0	I really don't because it not working and the countries aren't agreeing to it and the rebels aren't agreeing and Syria is not agreeing.
1683	0	So It's a meaningless ceasefire.
1684	0	I love the idea of a ceasefire.
1685	0	I love the idea of -- with a total cessation.
1686	0	"But it's not working, as you know very well."
1687	0	It's not working.
1688	0	If -- we can do what we want with Russia but nobody else is adhering to it.
1689	0	"So I certainly support it, I would certainly love it, but all parties have to be part of it."
1690	0	"Senator Cruz, your opinion on the ceasefire."
1691	0	Well look.
1692	0	"We're certainly hopeful that the violence will cease, but there's reason to be highly skeptical."
1693	0	"Russia has enhanced its position because of Obama's weakness in the Middle East, weakness in Syria."
1694	0	"And you know, as we're headed to November, we need no nominate a Republican candidate that can lay out a clear difference with both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy."
1695	0	One of the real challenges with both Donald and Senator Rubio is that they have agreed over and over again with both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
1696	1	"So for example, in Libya, both of them agreed with the Obama/Clinton policy of toppling the government in Libya."
1697	0	That was a disaster.
1698	0	It gave the country over to radical Islamic terrorism and it endangered America.
1699	0	Another example is John Kerry.
1700	0	John Kerry -- Senator Rubio voted to confirm John Kerry as secretary of State.
1701	0	I voted against him.
1702	0	"And Donald Trump supported John Kerry against George W. Bush in 2004, gave him a check."
1703	0	And John Kerry has been the most anti-Israel secretary of State this country has ever seen.
1704	0	His diplomacy has been a disaster.
1705	0	"And if we nominate someone who agreed with John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy, we're not in a strong position to win the general election."
1706	0	(APPLAUSE)
1707	0	"A response, Mr. Trump, then Mr. Rubio."
1708	0	"Again, I think I gave them both checks to be exactly honest."
1709	0	I think they both liked me very much.
1710	0	But the fact is that ...
1711	0	But you called for Bush to be impeached.
1712	0	"Well, I think Bush did a hell of a bad as far as that's concerned."
1713	0	You know it and so do I.
1714	0	But you gave him a check and called for him to be impeached.
1715	0	Be honest.
1716	0	Be honest.
1717	0	"No, this was before."
1718	0	The check came early.
1719	0	"But let me just tell you, Syria, he's saying that I was in favor of Syria."
1720	0	He said I was in favor of Libya?
1721	1	I never discussed that subject.
1722	0	I was in favor of Libya?
1723	0	We would be so much better off if Gadhafi were in charge right now.
1724	0	"If these politicians went to the beach and didn't do a thing, and we had Saddam Hussein and if we had Gadhafi in charge, instead of having terrorism all over the place, we'd be -- at least they killed terrorists, all right?"
1725	0	"And I'm not saying they were good because they were bad, they were really bad, but we don't know what we're getting."
1726	0	"You look at Libya right now, ISIS, as we speak, is taking over their oil."
1727	0	"As we speak, it's a total mess."
1728	0	We would have been better off if the politicians took a day off instead of going into war.
1729	0	(APPLAUSE)
1730	0	Senator Rubio.
1731	0	"Yes, a couple of points."
1732	0	"Number one, on the Libya situation, we didn't topple Gadhafi, the Libyan people toppled Gadhafi."
1733	0	"The only choice before America that this president had to make is, does it happen quickly or does it take a long time?"
1734	0	"And I argued if it takes a long time, you're going to have rebel forces emerge like these radical Islamists to take advantage of the vacuum."
1735	0	And that's what happened.
1736	0	"That's where the term ""lead from behind"" came."
1737	0	And that's the foreign policy that apparently Senator Cruz appears to agree with.
1738	0	"On John Kerry, yes, you know why, because every day John Kerry wasn't appointed was another day Hillary Clinton was still in charge of the State Department."
1739	0	And she was absolutely horrible.
1740	0	"I couldn't imagine that they were going to find somebody even worse than her, but this president never ceases to amaze."
1741	0	(LAUGHTER)
1742	0	(APPLAUSE)
1743	0	"And the last point I would make on South Korea, now this is important, because we're asking to be commander-in-chief."
1744	0	Donald is asking to be commander-in-chief.
1745	0	And he's saying these guys need to do more.
1746	0	South Korea contributes $800 million a year to that effort.
1747	0	And Japan contributes as well.
1748	0	"And here's why our commitment to that regional security is so critical, Donald, because if we walk away from them, both Japan and South Korea will become nuclear weapons powers."
1749	0	They can do that very quickly.
1750	0	"And that's what they will do if the American defense agreements wither away, which is why we have to rebuild the military, but why we can't walk away from our Asia-Pacific defense status."
1751	0	Mr. Trump.
1752	0	I never said walk away.
1753	0	I wouldn't want to walk away.
1754	0	I want them to pay us much more money.
1755	0	We cannot afford to subsidize...
1756	0	How much?
1757	0	A lot.
1758	0	I'll negotiate a lot more money than you'll ever get.
1759	0	"As far as John Kerry is concerned, there has been no tougher critic of this man, I think he negotiated one of the worst deals in the history of our country, the Iran deal, where they get their $150 billion and all of the other things that take place."
1760	0	"It is a disaster for this country, and speaking of Israel, it's a disaster for Israel."
1761	0	I'm no fan of John Kerry.
1762	0	(CROSSTALK)
1763	0	"Hold on, hold on, Governor."
1764	0	Senator Cruz.
1765	0	"You know, it's interesting, Donald just said that he never came out in favor of toppling Gadhafi in Libya."
1766	0	"Well, he stated that in an interview that will be on our Web site, tedcruz.org."
1767	0	You can see and hear the exact words from Donald's mouth.
1768	0	"And I assume when he sees that interview, maybe he forgot about it, but I assume Donald will apologize where he sees that he said exactly that."
1769	0	"With regard to John Kerry, I will say John Kerry's foreign policy has been a disaster for decades."
1770	0	That's why I voted against him when he came up.
1771	0	And the fact that Donald Trump would write him a check and support him against George W. Bush shows exceptionally poor foreign policy judgment.
1772	0	And I'll give one more example on Israel.
1773	0	"When the Obama administration canceled civilian air flights into the national of Israel, when Hamas was raining rockets down on them, I publicly asked, is this an economic boycott against Israel?"
1774	0	"The next day Michael Bloomberg, another New York billionaire, got on a plane, a commercial flight, and flew to Israel from London."
1775	0	Together the heat and light that was put on the State Department was so great that within 36 hours they lifted the ban on air flights into Israel.
1776	0	"During that entire battle, and indeed during every battle on Israel the natural question is, where was Donald?"
1777	0	"If this is something he cares about, why has he supported anti-Israel politicians from Jimmy Carter to Hillary Clinton to John Kerry for four decades?"
1778	0	"If you care about Israel, you don't write checks to politicians who are undermining Israel."
1779	0	Instead you stand and support the national security of America and the alliance with Israel.
1780	0	(CROSSTALK)
1781	0	There's a critical point that needs to be made here.
1782	0	(APPLAUSE)
1783	0	"Governor, Governor, Governor, he attacked Mr. Trump."
1784	0	Mr. Trump has a right to respond.
1785	0	"Well, look, my response is very simple."
1786	0	There is nobody on this stage that has done more for Israel than I have.
1787	0	Nobody.
1788	0	"You might say, you might talk, you're politicians, all talk, no action."
1789	0	(APPLAUSE)
1790	0	I've been watching it all my life.
1791	0	You are all talk and no action.
1792	0	Then name one specific thing you've done.
1793	0	"What I've seen up here -- I mean, first of all, this guy is a choke artist, and this guy is a liar."
1794	0	You have a combination...
1795	0	This guy always goes for...
1796	0	You have a combination of factors.
1797	0	He can't do it...
1798	0	This is so typical.
1799	0	"... for the obvious reason, and he can't do it because he doesn't know how to tell the truth."
1800	0	"Other than that, I rest my case."
1801	0	(CROSSTALK)
1802	0	"One at a time, gentlemen."
1803	0	"Governor Kasich, you have the floor."
1804	0	Governor...
1805	0	(CROSSTALK)
1806	0	You will have a response.
1807	0	But I promised Governor Kasich he could respond.
1808	0	"Can somebody attack me, please?"
1809	0	(LAUGHTER)
1810	0	(APPLAUSE)
1811	0	"There's something -- I want to -- I want to point out something here today that is -- it's so critically important -- about how the Obama administration has really done such a ridiculous, feckless job here in foreign policy."
1812	0	"First of all, we should have been supporting the rebels long ago."
1813	0	"They could have taken Assad out, and because we did nothing, the Russians are in, and they're sitting in the catbird seat."
1814	0	We should have been helping them.
1815	0	I'm thankful that the aid trucks are finally getting into Syria.
1816	0	"But the fact is, had we had acted, we would have solved that problem."
1817	0	"Now, let's talk about Libya."
1818	0	Libya didn't go down because there was some people revolution.
1819	0	"Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power and all these other people convinced the president to undermine Gadhafi."
1820	0	"They undermined him, and now they have created a cesspool in Libya."
1821	0	And let me just say to you -- we have ISIS beginning get -- get a foothold in Libya.
1822	0	We're gonna have to deal with it.
1823	0	There are not many major cities in Libya.
1824	0	"They're on the coast, which -- mostly, it's desert, but it's a problem."
1825	0	"Then we have ISIS in -- in Syria, and we have ISIS in Iraq."
1826	0	"Because this administration has not had a strong and firm foreign policy, we are going to inherit -- one of us here is going to inherit a total mess..."
1827	0	All right...
1828	0	"... and we're going to have to work our way out of it, including..."
1829	0	Let's continue.
1830	0	... the need to arm the Ukrainians.
1831	0	"They have been ignored, and we need to help them as well..."
1832	0	Let us continue.
1833	0	... and assert ourselves as America.
1834	0	Let's continue the questioning on ISIS.
1835	0	Maria.
1836	0	"Hold on, Wolf."
1837	0	You said I got a response.
1838	0	You'll have a chance.
1839	0	Maria will pick up...
1840	0	(CROSSTALK)
1841	0	Hold on.
1842	0	He called me a liar.
1843	0	You're saying I can't respond to being called a liar?
1844	0	(CROSSTALK)
1845	0	Go ahead and respond.
1846	0	"You know, what we're seeing with Donald is actually the pattern of Washington -- the pattern of Washington deal makers, which is they make promises, they break their words, and then when anyone calls them on it, they call you a liar."
1847	0	And so that's Donald's pattern over and over again.
1848	0	"He said, for example, seven months ago -- this is Donald speaking, quote -- ""I, Donald Trump, was a member of the establishment."""
1849	0	There's a reason Harry Reid thinks he's the best Republican up here.
1850	0	"There's a reason Jimmy Carter said he would support Donald Trump over me, because he said Donald Trump is malleable, he has no fixed set of beliefs..."
1851	0	(BELL RINGS)
1852	0	... whereas Ted Cruz is not malleable.
1853	0	And every time anyone points at Donald's actual record...
1854	0	Thank you.
1855	0	"... what he said on national television, Donald yells ""liar."""
1856	0	Let me tell you something -- falsely accusing someone of lying is itself a lie...
1857	0	"Go ahead, Mr. Trump."
1858	0	... and it's something Donald does daily.
1859	0	"Go ahead, Mr. Trump."
1860	0	I watched -- I watched...
1861	0	(APPLAUSE)
1862	0	... the lobbyists.
1863	0	"I watched what this man did to Dr. Ben Carson, who I respect, in Iowa, where he said that Ben Carson is out of the race -- he has left Iowa and he's out of the race."
1864	0	And I thought it was disgraceful.
1865	0	And got a lot of votes because of that -- a lot of votes.
1866	0	Took them away from Ben Carson.
1867	0	I watched that.
1868	0	"Probably took them away from me, too."
1869	0	But I watched it.
1870	0	"I also watched where he did a forum that looked like it came right out of a government agency, and it said on top, ""Voter Violation,"" and then it graded you..."
1871	0	(BELL RINGS)
1872	0	"... and it scared the hell out of people, and it said the only way you clear up the violation, essentially, is to go and vote for Ted Cruz."
1873	0	"I watched that fraudulent document, and I said it's the worst thing I've ever seen in politics."
1874	0	(BELL RINGS)
1875	0	"To me, that was even worse than what he did to Ben."
1876	0	Senator Cruz...
1877	0	(CROSSTALK)
1878	0	"I know politicians -- I know politicians, believe it or not, better than you do."
1879	0	And it's not good.
1880	0	I believe it.
1881	0	"No, no."
1882	0	"I believe you know politicians much better than I do, because for 40 years, you've been funding liberal Democratic politicians."
1883	0	And by the way...
1884	0	I funded you.
1885	0	I funded him.
1886	0	Can you believe it?
1887	0	(APPLAUSE)
1888	0	... the reason is -- you're welcome to have the check back.
1889	0	I funded this guy.
1890	0	I gave him a check.
1891	0	"Yeah, you gave me $5,000."
1892	0	I gave him a check.
1893	0	He never funded me.
1894	0	"And -- and by the way, let's be clear."
1895	0	(APPLAUSE)
1896	0	Donald claims -- Donald claims to care about...
1897	0	You know why?
1898	0	"I didn't want to, but he sent me his book with his autograph..."
1899	0	(CROSSTALK)
1900	0	Donald.
1901	0	Donald.
1902	0	Donald.
1903	0	I understand rules are very hard for you.
1904	0	They're very confusing.
1905	0	"Mr. Trump, you're doing a great job."
1906	0	I have his book.
1907	0	(CROSSTALK)
1908	0	Thank you -- thank you for the book.
1909	0	Go ahead.
1910	0	"Donald, you can get back on your meds now."
1911	0	"This is a lot of fun up here tonight, I have to tell you."
1912	0	(APPLAUSE)
1913	0	Thank -- thank you for the book.
1914	0	I really appreciate (ph).
1915	0	"Donald -- Donald, relax."
1916	0	Go ahead.
1917	0	I'm relaxed.
1918	0	You're the basket case.
1919	0	(CROSSTALK)
1920	0	Go ahead.
1921	0	Donald...
1922	0	Go ahead.
1923	0	Don't get nervous.
1924	0	(inaudible)...
1925	0	Go ahead.
1926	0	(CROSSTALK)
1927	0	"I promise you, Donald, there's nothing about you..."
1928	0	I've seen you.
1929	0	... that makes anyone nervous.
1930	0	You're losing so badly you -- I want to...
1931	0	"You know, people are actually watching this at home."
1932	0	I -- you don't know what's happening.
1933	0	(CROSSTALK)
1934	0	"Gentlemen, gentlemen."
1935	0	"Wolf, I'm going to ask my time not be deducted when he's yelling at me."
1936	0	You've gotta stop this.
1937	0	(CROSSTALK)
1938	0	"The latest debate -- gentlemen, please."
1939	0	"Hold on, I'm going to get my answer."
1940	0	He doesn't get to yell the whole time.
1941	0	I want to move -- I want to move on.
1942	0	These are the rules.
1943	0	(CROSSTALK)
1944	0	"Excuse me, he called me a liar, then interrupted the whole time."
1945	0	Am I allowed to...
1946	0	(CROSSTALK)
1947	0	(APPLAUSE)
1948	0	"Wolf, do I not get a response?"
1949	0	Do I not get a response without being interrupted?
1950	0	"You'll get -- you'll get plenty of response, so stand by."
1951	0	My name was mentioned.
1952	0	"I want to talk -- I want to talk about ISIS right now, and the federal government -- how much best to keep Americans safe from ISIS."
1953	0	There's a huge battle underway right now between the tech giant Apple and the federal government.
1954	0	The federal government wants Apple to unlock the phone used by that San Bernardino terrorist to prevent future attacks.
1955	0	"Apple has refused, saying it would compromise the security of all of its customers."
1956	0	"And just this afternoon, they went to court to block the judge's order."
1957	0	"Dana Bash, pick up the questioning."
1958	0	"Senator Rubio, you say it's complicated, and that, quote, ""Apple isn't necessarily wrong to refuse the court order."""
1959	0	Why shouldn't investigators have everything at their disposal?
1960	0	"No, in fact what I have said is the only thing -- the FBI made this very clear 48 hours ago -- the only thing they are asking of Apple is that Apple allow them to use their own systems in the FBI to try to guess the password of the San Bernardino killer."
1961	0	"Apple initially came out saying, ""We're being ordered to create a back door to an encryption device."""
1962	0	That is not accurate.
1963	0	"The only thing they're being asked to do, and the FBI made this very clear about 48 hours ago, is allow us to disable the self- destruct mode that's in the Apple phone so that we can try to guess using our own systems what the password of this killer was."
1964	0	And I think they should comply with that.
1965	0	"If that's all they're asking for, they are not asking for Apple to create a back door to encryption."
1966	0	"So just to be clear, you did say on CNN a couple of weeks ago this is a complicated issue; Apple is not necessarily wrong here."
1967	0	"Because at the time, Apple was portraying that the court order was to create a back door to an encryption device."
1968	0	"But just to be clear -- just to be clear, if you are president, would you instruct your Justice Department to force Apple to comply or not?"
1969	0	To comply with an order that says that they have to allow the FBI the opportunity to try to guess the password?
1970	0	Correct.
1971	0	Absolutely.
1972	0	That Apple phone didn't even belong to the killer.
1973	0	It belonged to the killer's employee (sic) who have agreed to allow him to try to do this.
1974	0	That is all they're asking them to do is to disable the self-destruct mode or the auto-erase mode on one phone in the entire world.
1975	0	But Apple doesn't want to do it because they think it hurts their brand.
1976	0	"Well, let me tell you, their brand is not superior to the national security of the United States of America."
1977	0	(APPLAUSE)
1978	0	"Senator Cruz, Apple CEO Tim Cook says this would be bad for America."
1979	0	Where do you stand: national security or personal privacy?
1980	0	"Well, as you know, at that same CNN forum, both Marco and I were asked this question."
1981	0	"His answer, he was on both sides of the fence."
1982	0	He's now agreeing with me.
1983	0	And so I'm glad.
1984	0	"What I said is yes, Apple should be forced to comply with this court order."
1985	0	Why?
1986	0	"Because under the Fourth Amendment, a search and seizure is reasonable if it has judicial authorization and probable cause."
1987	0	"In this instance, the order is not put a back door in everyone's cell phone."
1988	0	"If that was the order, that order would be problematic because it would compromise security and safety for everyone."
1989	0	I would agree with Apple on that broad policy question.
1990	0	"But on the question of unlocking this cell phone of a terrorist, we should enforce the court order and find out everyone that terrorist at San Bernardino talked to on the phone, texted with, e-mailed."
1991	0	"And absolutely, Apple doesn't have a right to defy a valid court order in a terrorism investigation."
1992	0	(APPLAUSE)
1993	0	"Dr. Carson, Tim Cook, again, the CEO of Apple, says that this would be bad for America."
1994	0	What do you think?
1995	0	I think allowing terrorist to get away with things is bad for America.
1996	0	(APPLAUSE)
1997	0	"You know, we have the -- we have a Constitution."
1998	0	We have a Fourth Amendment.
1999	0	It guards us against illegal and unreasonable search and seizure.
2000	0	But we have mechanisms in place with the judicial system that will allow us to gain material that is necessary to benefit the nation as a whole or the community as a whole.
2001	0	And that's why we have FISA courts and things of that nature.
2002	0	"So absolutely, I would -- I would expect Apple to comply with the court order."
2003	0	"If they don't comply with that, you're encouraging chaos in our system."
2004	0	Mr. Trump...
2005	0	(APPLAUSE)
2006	0	I want to weigh in on this please.
2007	0	I want to just tell you that the problem is not right now between the administration and Apple.
2008	0	You know what the problem is?
2009	0	Where's the president been?
2010	0	You sit down in a back room and you sit down with the parties and you get this worked out.
2011	0	"You don't litigate this on the front page of the New York Times, where everybody in the world is reading about their dirty laundry out here."
2012	0	"The president of the United States should be convening a meeting, should have convened a meeting with Apple and our security forces."
2013	0	And then you know what you do when you're the president?
2014	0	You lock the door and you say you're not coming out until you reach an agreement that both gives the security people what they need and protects the rights of Americans.
2015	0	This is a failure of his leadership to get this done as an executive should be doing it.
2016	0	"And I'll tell you, that's why you want a governor."
2017	0	I do this all the time.
2018	0	And we reach agreements all the time.
2019	0	"Because as an executive, you've got to solve problems instead of fighting on the front page of the newspaper."
2020	0	"Thank you, Governor."
2021	0	(APPLAUSE)
2022	0	Thank you.
2023	0	"Mr. Trump, you have been very vocal about securing the Mexican border, but ISIS has called upon its supporters to conduct attacks on our neighbor to the North, Canada."
2024	0	"As a matter of fact, U.S. officials have warned that it is the Canadian border which is the most significant threat."
2025	0	You have said that you will not build a wall in Canada.
2026	0	"When it comes to national security, and the threat of terrorism, why does Mexico need a wall, and Canada doesn't?"
2027	0	"Isn't that, like, closing the front door, and leaving the back door open?"
2028	1	"First of all, you're talking about a border that's many, many times longer."
2029	0	You're talking about a massive border.
2030	0	"We have far less problem with that border than we do with our Southern border, and tremendous amounts -- you know, I won, I had the privilege of winning by a landslide, by the way, New Hampshire."
2031	0	"You go to New Hampshire, the first thing they talk about is heroin and drugs pouring in."
2032	0	"And, you wouldn't think this beautiful place -- it's beautiful."
2033	0	"With the trees and the roads, and the countryside."
2034	0	"Their biggest problem is heroin, and it's such a shame to see it."
2035	0	"They're pouring in from the Southern border, so I'm talking about great security."
2036	0	"I'm talking about a wall that can absolutely be built, and I'll build it on time, on budget."
2037	0	"It'll be a very high wall, a great wall."
2038	0	"It's going to be built, it's going to be built."
2039	0	"It's going to be paid for by Canada, by the way -- maybe I'll get Canada to pay?"
2040	0	Got to be paid for by Mexico.
2041	1	"The problem with Canada, you're talking about a massively long piece."
2042	1	You're talking about a border that would be about four times longer.
2043	0	"It would be very, very hard to do, and we -- it is not our biggest problem."
2044	0	I don't care what anyone says.
2045	0	It is not our big problem.
2046	0	"Our big problem is not only people coming in, and in many cases the wrong people, it's the tremendous amount of drugs that are coming in."
2047	0	(APPLAUSE)
2048	0	"I want to talk to you, Senator Rubio, about Puerto Rico."
2049	0	"As you know, Puerto Rico's in the midst of financial collapse, unable to pay it's debt of $72 billion dollars."
2050	0	"Puerto Rico is asking for bankruptcy protection which would give Puerto Rico, and Puerto Ricans, which are U.S. citizens, you know that -- the tools to restructure the debt."
2051	0	That is the same debt the other 50 states have.
2052	0	You oppose granting Puerto Rico that bankruptcy protection.
2053	0	"You say that it is only a last resort measure, but the government of Puerto Rico has said that bankruptcy is it's last resort."
2054	0	That that's where they are now.
2055	0	"How do you explain this very strong stance to the hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans that vote across the U.S. , and particularly in your state of Florida?"
2056	0	"Sure, because bankruptcy doesn't work unless you change the way you're operating, or you're going to be bankrupt again."
2057	0	"And, the problem with Puerto Rico is it's economy is not growing."
2058	0	"It has a massive exodus of professionals and others that are leaving to my home state of Florida, and all over the country."
2059	0	"They're coming to the mainland from Puerto Rico because the economy there is not growing, it's too expensive to do business there."
2060	0	The tax rate is too high.
2061	0	The government regulations are too extensive.
2062	0	"This year alone, with all the problems they're having, they barely cut their budget from one year to the next."
2063	0	"So, I think the leadership on the island has to show their willingness to get their house in order and put in place measures allow the economy there to grow again."
2064	0	"If the economy of Puerto Rico does not grow they will never generate the revenue to pay this debt, or the billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that they have on their books of promises they've made to future generations to make payments."
2065	0	"So, yes, if they do all of those things then we can explore the use of bankruptcy protection, but not as the first resort, which is what they're asking for, because it will not solve the problems on the island and you're going to continue to see hundreds of thousands of people leave that beautiful place, and coming to the mainland."
2066	0	"They're United States citizens, they're obviously entitled to do so, and we welcome them, but we would also prefer to see a Puerto Rico that once again is growing economically, and is robust."
2067	0	"And, the leaders in charge there now are doing a terrible job."
2068	0	"Their previous governor, Louis Fortuno was doing a great job until he barely lost that election to..."
2069	0	(BELL RINGING)
2070	0	... to someone who has taken a big government stance (ph) once again...
2071	0	"Senator, thank you very much."
2072	0	(APPLAUSE)
2073	0	"I want our viewers to stay with us right now, including the last pitch in the final debate before Super Tuesday."
2074	0	(APPLAUSE)
2075	0	(CHEERING)
2076	0	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
2077	0	(APPLAUSE)
2078	0	Welcome back to the University of Houston.
2079	0	It's time now for closing statements.
2080	0	All of you will have 30 seconds.
2081	0	"Dr. Carson, we'll start with you."
2082	0	"Well first of all, I want people to think about what kind of leader do you want and what kind of person do you want your kids to emulate."
2083	0	Think about that.
2084	0	"Secondly, several years ago, a movie was made about these hands."
2085	0	These hands by the grace of God have saved many lives and healed many families.
2086	0	"And I'm asking you tonight, America, to join hands with me to heal, inspire and revive America."
2087	0	"If not us, who?"
2088	0	"And if not now, when?"
2089	0	(APPLAUSE)
2090	0	Governor Kasich.
2091	0	"Well, the last USA Today poll had me beating Hillary Clinton by 11 points, more than anybody on this stage."
2092	0	"Secondly, I hope you saw tonight that executive experience really matters."
2093	0	"It matters in terms of growing our economy, balancing budgets, cutting taxes, reforming regulations."
2094	0	"I've done it in Washington, I've done it in Ohio, and I can go back to Washington and do it again."
2095	0	"But I hope you also noticed tonight that I do have the foreign policy experience, not just a few years, but a lot of years in working with some of the great, great minds in this country to develop the expertise, the confidence, the firmness, the toughness and the ability to bring people together."
2096	0	I hope you all think about giving me your vote.
2097	0	I would appreciate it very much.
2098	0	"And I tell you, we won't have to spend time figuring what we're going to do."
2099	0	I will hit the ground running and we will get America moving again.
2100	0	Thank you all very much.
2101	0	(APPLAUSE)
2102	0	Senator Rubio.
2103	0	"Well, thank you for having us tonight."
2104	0	"You know, this campaign has come a long way."
2105	0	It was just a few months ago there were 15 or 11 us on the stage and now it's narrowed and the votes are starting to count.
2106	0	"And we have an incredible decision to make, not just about the direction of America, but the identity of our party and of the conservative movement."
2107	0	The time for games is over.
2108	0	"I know you've had a lot of choices to make, but now it's time to narrow it down."
2109	0	"And I'm asking you to get behind me, go on our Web site and join you our effort, marcorubio.com, so we can bring an end to this silliness, this looniness, and once again re-embrace all the things that made America and the Republican Party the bearer of the conservative movement in this country."
2110	0	(APPLAUSE)
2111	0	Senator Cruz.
2112	0	Washington deals are bankrupting this country.
2113	0	"There are several deal-makers on this stage but there is only one person who has consistently stood up to both parties, fighting for the American people against the Washington deals."
2114	0	"If I'm elected president, on the first day in office I will rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action."
2115	0	I will instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and prosecute any criminal violations.
2116	0	I will instruct every federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty ends today.
2117	0	I will rip to shreds the Iranian -- catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal.
2118	0	And I will begin the process of moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.
2119	0	"We will repeal Obamacare, abolish of IRS, secure the border, and bring back jobs."
2120	0	(APPLAUSE)
2121	0	Mr. Trump.
2122	0	Thank you.
2123	0	Nobody knows politicians better than I do.
2124	0	"They're all talk, they're no action, nothing gets done."
2125	0	I've watched it for years.
2126	0	Take a look at what's happening to our country.
2127	0	"All of the things that I've been talking about, whether it's trade, whether it's building up our depleted military, whether it's taking care of our vets, whether it's getting rid of Common Core, which is a disaster, or knocking out Obamacare and coming up with something so much better, I will get it done."
2128	0	"Politicians will never, ever get it done."
2129	0	And we will make America great again.
2130	0	Thank you.
2131	0	(APPLAUSE)
2132	0	"Mr. Trump, thank you."
2133	0	"And thanks to each of the candidates, on behalf of everyone here at CNN and Telemundo."
2134	0	We also want to thank the Republican National Committee and the University of Houston.
2135	0	"My thanks also to Hugh Hewitt, Maria Celeste, and Dana Bash."
2136	0	Super Tuesday is only five days away.
1	0	"Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders, you can now move to your lecterns while I explain a few ground rules."
2	0	"As moderator, I'll guide the discussion, asking questions and follow-ups."
3	0	You'll also get questions from Dana Bash and Errol Louis.
4	0	"You'll each have one minute and 15 seconds to answer questions, 30 seconds for follow- ups."
5	0	Timing lights will signal when your time is up.
6	0	Both candidates have agreed to these rules now.
7	0	"Opening statements, you'll each have two minutes."
8	0	Let's begin with Senator Sanders.
9	0	(APPLAUSE)
10	0	"Wolf, thank you very much."
11	0	"CNN, thank you very much."
12	0	"Secretary Clinton, thank you very much."
13	0	"When we began this campaign almost a year ago, we started off at 3 percent in the polls."
14	0	We were about 70 points behind Secretary Clinton.
15	0	"In the last couple of weeks, there were two polls out there that had us ahead."
16	0	(APPLAUSE)
17	0	"Of the last nine caucuses and primaries, we have won eight of them, many of them by landslide victories."
18	0	(APPLAUSE)
19	0	"Over the last year, we have received almost 7 million individual campaign contributions, averaging -- guess what -- $27 apiece, more individual campaign contributions than any candidate in American history at this point in a campaign."
20	0	The reason that our campaign has done so well is because we're doing something very radical: We're telling the American people the truth.
21	0	And the truth is that this country is not going to move forward in a significant way for working people unless we overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision...
22	0	(APPLAUSE)
23	0	... and unless we have real campaign reform so that billionaires and super PACs cannot buy elections.
24	0	(APPLAUSE)
25	0	"This campaign is also determined to end a rigged economy where the rich get richer and everybody else get poorer, and create an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent."
26	0	Thank you.
27	0	Secretary Clinton?
28	0	"Well, first of all, it's great to be here in New York, and I am delighted to..."
29	0	(APPLAUSE)
30	0	... have this chance to discuss the issues that are important to our future.
31	0	I was so honored to serve as a senator from New York for eight years...
32	0	(APPLAUSE)
33	0	... and to work to provide opportunity for all of our citizens to make it possible that we could knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead.
34	0	"And during those eight years, we faced some difficult challenges together."
35	0	We faced 9/11.
36	0	We worked hard to rebuild New York.
37	0	I was particularly concerned about our first responders and others who'd been affected in their health by what they had experienced.
38	0	We worked hard to bring jobs from Buffalo to Albany and all parts of New York to give more hard-working people a chance to really make the most out of their own talents.
39	0	And we worked hard to really keep New York values at the center of who we are and what we do together.
40	0	(APPLAUSE)
41	0	And that is -- that is exactly what I want to do as your president.
42	0	We will celebrate our diversity.
43	0	"We will work together, bringing us back to being united, setting some big, bold, progressive goals for America."
44	0	"That's what I'm offering in this campaign, to build on the work, to build on the value that we share here in New York, to take those to Washington, and to knock down those barriers that in any way hold back not only individual Americans, bur our country from reaching our full potential."
45	0	That is what my campaign is about.
46	0	(APPLAUSE)
47	0	"Thank you, Secretary."
48	0	We are going to deal with many of the issues both of you just raised.
49	0	I want to begin with a question that goes right to the heart of which one of you should be the Democratic presidential nominee.
50	0	"Senator Sanders, in the last week, you've raised questions about Secretary Clinton's qualifications to be president."
51	0	You said that something is clearly lacking in terms of her judgment and you accused her of having a credibility gap.
52	0	"So let me ask you, do you believe that Secretary Clinton has the judgment to be president?"
53	0	"Well, I've known Secretary Clinton, how long, 25 years?"
54	0	We worked together in the Senate.
55	0	"And I said that in response to the kind of attacks we were getting from the Clinton, uh, campaign."
56	0	"Washington Post headline says ""Clinton Campaign says Sanders is Unqualified"" and that's what the surrogates were saying."
57	0	Does Secretary Clinton have the experience and the intelligence to be a president?
58	0	Of course she does.
59	0	(APPLAUSE)
60	0	But I do question...
61	0	(APPLAUSE)
62	0	-- but I do question her judgment.
63	0	I question a judgment which voted for the war in Iraq...
64	0	(APPLAUSE)
65	0	"-- the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country, voted for virtually every disastrous trade agreement which cost us millions of decent-paying jobs."
66	0	"And I question her judgment about running super PACs which are collecting tens of millions of dollars from special interests, including $15 million from Wall Street."
67	0	I don't believe that that is...
68	0	(APPLAUSE)
69	0	-- the kind of judgment we need to be the kind of president we need.
70	0	Secretary Clinton?
71	1	"Well, it is true that now that the spotlight is pretty bright here in New York, some things have been said and Senator Sanders did call me unqualified."
72	0	I've been called a lot of things in my life.
73	1	That was a first.
74	0	(LAUGHTER)
75	0	And then he did say that...
76	0	(APPLAUSE)
77	0	-- he had to question my judgment.
78	0	"Well, the people of New York voted for me twice to be their senator from New York and..."
79	0	(APPLAUSE)
80	0	-- and...
81	0	(APPLAUSE)
82	0	-- and President Obama trusted my judgment enough to ask me to be secretary of State for the United States.
83	0	(APPLAUSE)
84	0	"So, look, we have disagreements on policy."
85	0	There's no doubt about it.
86	0	"But if you go and read, which I hope all of you will before Tuesday, Senator Sanders' long interview with the ""New York Daily News,"" talk about judgment and talk about the kinds of problems he had answering questions about even his core issue, breaking up the banks."
87	0	"When asked, he could not explain how..."
88	0	(LAUGHTER)
89	0	-- that would be done and...
90	0	(APPLAUSE)
91	0	-- when asked...
92	0	(APPLAUSE)
93	0	"-- when asked about a number of foreign policy issues, he could not answer about Afghanistan, about Israel, about counterterrorism, except to say if he'd had some paper in front of him, maybe he could."
94	0	I think you need to have the judgment on day one to be both president and commander-in-chief.
95	0	Senator...
96	0	(APPLAUSE)
97	0	And let's talk about judgment.
98	0	Yes!
99	0	(APPLAUSE)
100	0	And let us talk about the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country...
101	0	(APPLAUSE)
102	0	I led the opposition to that war.
103	0	Secretary Clinton voted for that.
104	0	"Well, let's talk about judgment."
105	1	"Let's talk about super PACs and 501(c)(4)s, money which is completely undisclosed."
106	0	Where does the money come from?
107	0	Do we really feel confident about a candidate saying that she's going to bring change in America when she is so dependent on big money interests?
108	0	I don't think so.
109	0	(APPLAUSE)
110	0	"Well, let me..."
111	0	We have...
112	0	-- let me just say...
113	0	-- (INAUDIBLE)...
114	0	-- let me -- let me say...
115	0	"Madam Secretary, let him finish."
116	0	OK.
117	0	"Thirdly, we have got to understand that in America, we should be thinking big, not small."
118	0	(APPLAUSE)
119	0	Thank you.
120	0	We need to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all people.
121	0	So I...
122	0	(APPLAUSE)
123	0	-- my (INAUDIBLE).
124	0	"Thank you, Senator."
125	0	Secretary?
126	0	"Well, make -- make no mistake about it, this is not just an attack on me, it's an attack on President Obama."
127	0	President Obama...
128	0	(BOOS)
129	0	"You know, let me tell you why."
130	0	"You may not like the answer, but I'll tell you why."
131	0	President Obama had a super PAC when he ran.
132	0	President Obama took tens of millions of dollars from contributors.
133	0	"And President Obama was not at all influenced when he made the decision to pass and sign Dodd-Frank, the toughest regulations..."
134	0	(APPLAUSE)
135	0	-- on Wall Street in many a year.
136	0	"So this is -- this is a phony -- this is a phony attack that is designed to raise questions when there is no evidence or support, to undergird the continuation that he is putting forward in these attacks."
137	0	"Thank, Secretary."
138	0	"We're going to continue on this, but I want Dana Bash to continue with the questioning."
139	0	"Secretary Clint, the government announced yesterday that five of the biggest banks on Wall Street have failed to develop plans to dismantle themselves in the event of another financial crisis."
140	0	This is the second time in two years those banks neglected to come up with credible plans.
141	0	"So, as president, would you call on regulators to start the process of breaking up these banks?"
142	0	"Something that the law not only allows, but actually explicitly encourages?"
143	0	Absolutely.
144	0	"You know, this is what I've saying for the past year."
145	0	"No bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail."
146	0	I have been talking about what we should be doing under Dodd- Frank.
147	0	"I'm glad that Senator Sanders is now joining in talking about Dodd-Frank, because Dodd-Frank sets forth the approach that needs to be taken."
148	0	"I believe, and I will appoint regulators who are tough enough and ready enough to break up any bank that fails the test under Dodd-Frank."
149	0	There are two sections there.
150	0	"If they fail either one, that they're a systemic risk, a grave risk to our economy, or if they fail the other, that their living wills, which is what you're referring to, is inadequate."
151	0	Let's look at what is at stake here.
152	0	We can never let Wall Street wreck Main street again.
153	0	I spoke out against Wall Street when I was a Senator from New York.
154	0	I have been standing up and saying continuously we have the law.
155	0	We've got to execute under it.
156	0	"So, you're right."
157	0	"I will move immediately to break up any financial institution, but I go further because I want the law to extend to those that are part of the shadow banking industry."
158	0	"The big insurance companies, the hedge funds, something that I have been arguing for now a long time..."
159	0	"... Thank you, Secretary."
160	0	"Senator Sanders, you were recently asked what you would replace the big Wall Street banks with if you could break them up."
161	0	"You said, quote, ""That's their decision."""
162	0	Why would you trust the banks to restructure themselves?
163	0	"First, Dana..."
164	0	when you said the whole business model was fraudulent?
165	0	That's right.
166	0	"So, let's start off with the basic premise."
167	0	A few days ago Goldman Sachs formally reached a settlement with the United States government for $5 billion dollars.
168	0	"What Goldman Sachs acknowledged was, essentially, that they were selling fraudulent packages of subprime mortgage loans."
169	0	"Goldman Sachs was not the only bank, other banks, of course, did the same."
170	0	"Now, I don't need Dodd-Frank now to tell me that we have got to break up these banks, A, because they're based on fraudulent principles, and B, because when you have six financial institutions that have assets equivalent to 58% of the GFP of this country, they are just too big, too much concentration of wealth and power."
171	0	"But, Senator..."
172	0	The point is we have got to break them up so that they do not pose a systemic risk and so that we have a vibrant economy with a competitive financial system.
173	0	"But Senator, you didn't answer the specific question which is not just about breaking up the banks, but why allow the banks to do it themselves?"
174	0	Because I'm not sure that the government should say is you are too big to fail.
175	0	You've got to be a certain size.
176	0	"And, then the banks themselves can figure out what they want to sell off."
177	0	I don't know that it's appropriate that the Department of Treasury to be making those decisions.
178	0	What we need is to make sure that they are safe.
179	0	(APPLAUSE)
180	0	"Dana, you know -- I love being in Brooklyn."
181	0	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
182	0	"Dana, let me add here that there are two ways to at this under Dodd-Frank, which is after all the law we passed under President Obama, and I'm proud that Barney Frank, one of the authors, has endorsed me because what I have said continuously is, yes, sometimes the government may have to order certain actions."
183	0	Sometime the government can permit the institution themselves to take those actions.
184	0	That has to be the judgement of the regulators.
185	0	"But, there's another element to this."
186	0	I believe strongly that executives of any of these organizations should be financially penalized if there is a settlement.
187	0	(APPLAUSE)
188	0	"They should have to pay up through compensation or bonuses because we have to go after not just the big giant institution, we have got to go after the people who are making the decisions in the institutions."
189	0	"Thank you, Madam Secretary."
190	0	And hold them accountable as well.
191	0	(APPLAUSE)
192	0	"Senator Sanders, you have consistently criticized Secretary Clinton for accepting money from Wall Street."
193	0	Can you name one decision that she made as senator that shows that he favored banks because of the money she received?
194	0	Sure.
195	0	Sure.
196	0	"The obvious decision is when the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of wall street brought this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- the Great Depression of the '30s, when millions of people lost their jobs, and their homes, and their life savings, the obvious response to that is that you've got a bunch of fraudulent operators and that they have got to be broken up."
197	0	"That was my view way back, and I introduced legislation to do that."
198	0	"Now, Secretary Clinton was busy giving speeches to Goldman Sachs for $225,000 a speech."
199	0	(APPLAUSE)
200	0	So the problem response -- the proper response in my view is we should break them up.
201	0	And that's what my legislation does.
202	0	"Well, you can tell, Dana, he cannot come up with any example, because there is no example."
203	0	(APPLAUSE)
204	0	It is important -- it's always important.
205	0	"It may be inconvenient, but it's always important to get the facts straight."
206	0	I stood up against the behaviors of the banks when I was a senator.
207	0	I called them out on their mortgage behavior.
208	0	I also was very willing to speak out against some of the special privileges they had under the tax code.
209	0	"When I went to the secretary of state office, the president -- President Obama led the effort to pass the Dodd-Frank bill."
210	0	That is the law.
211	0	"Now, this is our ninth debate."
212	0	"In the prior eight debates, I have said, we have a law."
213	0	"You don't just say, we're upset about this."
214	0	I'm upset about it.
215	0	"You don't just say, go break them up."
216	0	"You have a law, because we are a nation of laws."
217	0	"Thank you, Madam Secretary."
218	0	"So I support Dodd-Frank, but I have consistently said that's not enough."
219	0	We've got to include the shadow banking sector.
220	0	Thank you.
221	0	Senator Sanders.
222	0	(APPLAUSE)
223	0	Secretary Clinton called them out.
224	0	"Oh my goodness, they must have been really crushed by this."
225	0	And was that before or after you received huge sums of money by giving speaking engagements?
226	0	"So they must have been very, very upset by what you did."
227	0	"Look, here is the difference and here is the clear difference."
228	0	"These banks, in my view, have too much power."
229	0	They have shown themselves to be fraudulent organizations endangering the well-being of our economy.
230	0	"If elected president, I will break them up."
231	0	"We have got legislation to do that, end of discussion."
232	0	(APPLAUSE)
233	0	"Secretary Clinton, if I may, Senator Sanders keeping bringing up the speeches that you gave to Goldman Sachs."
234	0	"So I'd like to ask you, so you've said that you don't want to release the transcripts, until everybody does it, but if there's nothing in those speeches that you think would change voters' minds, why not just release the transcripts and put this whole issue to bed?"
235	0	(APPLAUSE)
236	0	"You know, first of all -- first of all, there isn't an issue."
237	0	"When I was in public service serving as the senator from New York, I did stand up to the banks."
238	0	I did make it clear that their behavior would not be excused.
239	0	"I'm the only one on this stage who did not vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives, as Senator Sanders did, which led to a lot of the problems that we had with Lehman Brothers."
240	0	"Now, if you're going to look at the problems that actually caused the Great Recession, you've got to look at the whole picture."
241	0	"It was a giant insurance company, AIG."
242	0	"It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers."
243	0	It was mortgage companies like Countrywide.
244	0	I'm not saying that Senator Sanders did something untoward when he voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives...
245	0	Madam Secretary...
246	0	... but the fact is he did.
247	0	And that contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers and started the cascade...
248	0	(APPLAUSE)
249	0	(CROSSTALK)
250	0	"Senator Sanders, one second, please."
251	0	"Secretary Clinton, the question was about the transcripts of the speeches to Goldman Sachs."
252	0	(APPLAUSE)
253	0	Why not release them?
254	0	"I have said, look, there are certain -- there are certain expectations when you run for president."
255	0	This is a new one.
256	0	"And I've said, if everybody agrees to do it -- because there are speeches for money on the other side."
257	0	I know that.
258	0	"But I will tell you this, there is -- there is a long-standing expectation that everybody running release their tax returns, and you can go -- you can go to my website and see eight years of tax returns."
259	0	And I've released 30 years of tax returns.
260	0	"And I think every candidate, including Senator Sanders and Donald Trump, should do the same."
261	0	(APPLAUSE)
262	0	"Secretary Clinton, we're going to get to the tax returns later, but just to put a button on this, you're running now for the Democratic nomination."
263	0	Right.
264	0	And it is your Democratic opponent and many Democratic voters who want to see those transcripts.
265	0	It's not about the Republicans...
266	0	(CROSSTALK)
267	0	(APPLAUSE)
268	0	"You know, let's set the same standard for everybody."
269	0	"When everybody does it, OK, I will do it, but let's set and expect the same standard on tax returns."
270	0	"Everybody does it, and then we move forward."
271	0	Thank you.
272	0	"Well, let me respond."
273	0	"Secretary Clinton, you just heard her, everybody else does it, she'll do it."
274	0	I will do it.
275	0	(APPLAUSE)
276	0	"I am going to release all of the transcripts of the speeches that I gave on Wall Street behind closed doors, not for $225,000, not for $2,000, not for two cents."
277	0	There were no speeches.
278	0	(APPLAUSE)
279	0	"And second of all, of course we will release our taxes."
280	0	Jane does our taxes.
281	0	We've been a little bit busy lately.
282	0	You'll excuse us.
283	0	But we will...
284	0	Senator...
285	0	We will get them out.
286	0	Senator...
287	0	"Well, you know, there are a lot of copy machines around."
288	0	"Senator, when are you -- when are you -- you've been asked for weeks and weeks to release your tax returns."
289	0	"Well, I think we got one that's coming out tomorrow."
290	0	Which one?
291	0	Last year's.
292	0	2014?
293	0	Yes.
294	0	"What about 2013, all the other ones?"
295	0	"You'll get them, yes."
296	0	"Yeah, look, I don't want to get anybody very excited."
297	0	They are very boring tax returns.
298	0	"No big money from speeches, no major investments."
299	0	"Unfortunately -- unfortunately, I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate."
300	0	And that's what that will show.
301	0	(APPLAUSE)
302	0	"So, Senator, just to be clear, tomorrow you will release the 2014 tax returns from you and your family?"
303	0	Yes.
304	0	And what about the earlier ones?
305	0	What's the problem... SANDERS: Yes.
306	0	What's taking so long?
307	0	"Because you just have to go to the filing cabinet, make a copy, and release them."
308	0	(APPLAUSE)
309	0	"Wolf, the answer is, you know, what we have always done in my family is, Jane does them."
310	0	And she's been out on the campaign trail.
311	0	We will get them out.
312	0	We'll get them out very shortly.
313	0	It's not a big deal.
314	0	Thank you.
315	0	"Senator, Senator, you've slammed companies like General Electric and Verizon for moving jobs outside of the United States."
316	0	"Yesterday, the CEO of Verizon called your views contemptable and said in your home state of Vermont Verizon has invested more than $16 million and pays millions of dollars a year to local businesses."
317	0	"He says you are, quote, ""uninformed on this issue"" and disconnected from reality."
318	0	"Given your obvious contempt for large American corporations, how would you as president of the United States be able to effectively promote American businesses around the world?"
319	0	"Well, for a start, I would tell the gentleman who's the CEO at Verizon to start negotiating with the Communication Workers of America."
320	0	(APPLAUSE)
321	0	"And this is -- this is a perfect example, Wolf, of the kind of corporate greed which is destroying the middle class of this country."
322	0	This gentleman makes $18 million a year in salary.
323	0	That's his -- that's his compensation.
324	0	"This gentleman is now negotiating to take away health care benefits of Verizon workers, outsource call center jobs to the Philippines, and -- and trying to create a situation where workers will lose their jobs."
325	0	He is not investing in the way he should in inner cities in America.
326	0	(APPLAUSE)
327	0	All right.
328	0	"Senator, but the question was, the question was, given your contempt for large American corporations, as president, how would you be able to promote American business around the world?"
329	0	"First of all, the word contempt is not right."
330	0	There are some great businesses who treat their workers and the environment with respect.
331	0	(APPLAUSE)
332	0	Verizon happens not to be one of them.
333	0	(APPLAUSE)
334	0	"And what we need to do is to tell this guy Immelt, who's the head of General Electric, he doesn't like me, well, that's fine."
335	0	He has outsourced hundreds of thousands of decent-paying jobs throughout the world...
336	0	(APPLAUSE)
337	0	"-- cut his workforce here substantially and in a given year, by the way, it turns out that both Verizon and General Electric, in a given year, pay nothing in federal income tax despite making billions in profits."
338	0	(BOOS)
339	0	"But Senator, experts say that no matter the means to bring back these jobs to the United States, prices of goods for consumers in the United States would go up, which would disproportionately impact the poor and middle class."
340	0	So how do you bring back these jobs to the United States without affecting the cost of goods to America's middle class and poor?
341	0	"Well, for a start, we're going to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour."
342	0	(APPLAUSE)
343	0	"And number two, while it is true we may end up paying a few cents more for a hamburger in McDonald's, at the end of the day, what this economy desperately needs is to rebuild our manufacturing sector with good-paying jobs."
344	0	(APPLAUSE)
345	0	"We cannot continue to sustain the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs that we have seen over the last 20, 30 years, based on trade agreements of which Secretary Clinton has voted for almost every one of those."
346	0	That has got to change.
347	0	Thank you.
348	0	Secretary...
349	0	(LAUGHTER)
350	0	-- Secretary Clinton?
351	0	(APPLAUSE)
352	0	"Well, first of all, I do have a very comprehensive plan to create more jobs and I think that has to be at the center of our economic approach."
353	0	And so I think it is important that we do more on manufacturing.
354	0	"I went to Syracuse and laid out a $10 billion plan that would, I believe, really jump-start advanced manufacturing."
355	0	I have seen the results of what can happen when we have the government cooperating with business.
356	0	And that's exactly what I will do.
357	0	"When I was secretary of State, I helped to lead the way to increased exports of American good around the world, which supports tens of thousands of jobs."
358	0	So I think you've got to go at this with a sense of how to accomplish the goal we are setting -- more good jobs with rising incomes for people everywhere from inner cities to rural areas to every distressed community in America.
359	0	And that's exactly what my plan would bring about.
360	0	I think we have a pretty good record if we look at what happened...
361	0	Senator...
362	0	"-- in the 1990s, we got 23 million new jobs and incomes went up for everybody."
363	0	Thank you.
364	0	Let's do that again in America.
365	0	"Senator, how do you..."
366	0	I'm going to respond...
367	0	I'll have you respond in a moment.
368	0	(APPLAUSE)
369	0	Stand by.
370	0	"Well, look..."
371	0	Secretary Clinton... (CROSSTALK)
372	0	"You will respond in a moment, but I have to follow-up with Secretary Clinton."
373	0	You stood on the stage with Governor Cuomo in support of new legislation to raise New York's minimum wage to $15 an hour.
374	0	But you do not support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.
375	0	As president...
376	0	(APPLAUSE)
377	0	"-- if a Democratic Congress put a $15 minimum wage bill on your desk, would you sign it?"
378	0	"Well, of course I would."
379	1	And I have supported...
380	0	(APPLAUSE)
381	1	-- I have supported the fight for 15.
382	0	I am proud to have the endorsement of most of the unions that have led the fight for 15.
383	0	"I was proud to stand on the stage with Governor Cuomo, with SEIU and others who have been leading this battle and I will work as hard as I can to raise the minimum wage."
384	0	I always have.
385	1	I supported that when I was in the Senate.
386	0	"Well, look..."
387	0	"But what I have also said is that we've got to be smart about it, just the way Governor Cuomo was here in New York."
388	0	"If you look at it, we moved more quickly to $15 in New York City, more deliberately toward $12, $12.50 upstate then to $15."
389	0	That is exactly my position.
390	0	It's a model for the nation and that's what I will do as president.
391	0	Thank you.
392	0	Go as quickly as...
393	0	(CROSSTALK)
394	0	-- to get to $15.
395	0	(APPLAUSE)
396	0	I am sure a lot of people are very surprised to learn that you supported raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.
397	0	(APPLAUSE)
398	0	"You know, wait a minute..."
399	0	(INAUDIBLE).
400	0	-- wait a minute.
401	0	(INAUDIBLE).
402	0	"-- wait, wait..."
403	0	That's just not accurate.
404	0	Well...
405	0	"Come on, I have stood on the debate stage..."
406	0	-- well and I...
407	0	-- with Senator Sanders eight...
408	0	(CROSSTALK)
409	0	-- times.
410	0	Excuse me.
411	0	I have said the...
412	0	Well...
413	0	Exact same thing.
414	0	"Secretary, Senator, please."
415	0	If we can...
416	0	(CROSSTALK)
417	0	-- raise it to $15 in New York...
418	0	(CROSSTALK)
419	0	-- or Los Angeles or Seattle...
420	0	"Secretary, the viewers..."
421	0	-- let's do it.
422	0	"If you're both screaming at each other, the viewers won't be able to hear either of you."
423	0	OK.
424	0	So please...
425	0	I will...
426	0	-- don't talk over each other.
427	0	I believe I was...
428	0	(CROSSTALK)
429	0	Go ahead.
430	0	-- responding.
431	0	All right?
432	0	"When this campaign began, I said that we got to end the starvation minimum wage of $7.25, raise it to $15."
433	0	Secretary Clinton said let's raise it to $12.
434	0	There's a difference.
435	0	"And, by the way, what has happened is history has outpaced Secretary Clinton, because all over this country, people are standing up and they're saying $12 is not good enough, we need $15 an hour."
436	0	OK.
437	0	(APPLAUSE)
438	0	"Go ahead, Secretary."
439	0	Secretary?
440	0	And suddenly...
441	0	"Secretary, go ahead."
442	0	To suddenly...
443	0	Thank you.
444	0	Thank you very much.
445	0	"To suddenly announce now that you're for $15, I don't think is quite accurate."
446	0	All right.
447	0	Secretary?
448	0	All right.
449	0	I have said from the very beginning that I supported the fight for $15.
450	0	I supported those on the front lines of the fight for -- it happens to be true.
451	0	I also -- I supported the $15 effort in L.A.
452	0	I supported in Seattle.
453	0	I supported it for the fast food workers in New York.
454	0	"The minimum wage at the national level right now is $7.25, right?"
455	0	"We want to raise it higher than it ever has been, but we also have to recognize some states and some cities will go higher, and I support that."
456	1	"I have taken my cue from the Democrats in the Senate, led by Senator Patty Murray and others, like my good friend Kirsten Gillibrand, who has said we will set a national level of $12 and then urge any place that can go above it to go above it."
457	0	Going from $7.25 to $12 is a huge difference.
458	0	Thirty-five million people will get a raise.
459	0	One in four working mothers will get a raise.
460	0	I want to get something done.
461	1	"And I think setting the goal to get to $12 is the way to go, encouraging others to get to $15."
462	0	"But, of course, if we have a Democratic Congress, we will go to $15."
463	0	(APPLAUSE)
464	0	"Senator, go ahead."
465	0	"Well, I think the secretary has confused a lot of people."
466	0	I don't know how you're there for the fight for $15 when you say you want a $12-an-hour national minimum wage.
467	0	(APPLAUSE)
468	0	"Now, in fact -- in fact, there is an effort, Patty Murray has introduced legislation for $12 minimum wage."
469	0	That's good.
470	0	I introduced legislation for $15 an hour minimum wage which is better.
471	0	(APPLAUSE)
472	0	"And ultimately what we have got to determine is after massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent, when millions of our people are working longer hours for low wages..."
473	0	"Thank you, Senator."
474	0	"I think we have got to be clear, not equivocate, $15 in minimum wage in 50 states in this country as soon as possible."
475	0	Thank you.
476	0	(APPLAUSE)
477	0	"We're going to turn to another critically important issue right now, guns in America."
478	0	"Secretary Clinton, you've said that Vermont, Senator Sanders' home state, has, quote, ""the highest per capita number of guns that end up committing crimes in New York."""
479	0	But only 1.2 percent of the guns recovered in New York in 2014 were from Vermont.
480	0	"Are you seriously blaming Vermont, and implicitly Senator Sanders, for New York's gun violence?"
481	0	"No, of course not."
482	0	Of course not.
483	0	This is -- this is a serious difference between us.
484	0	(LAUGHTER)
485	0	"And what I want to start by saying -- it's not a laughing matter -- 90 people on average a day are killed or commit suicide or die in accidents from guns, 33,000 people a year."
486	0	"I take it really seriously, because I have spent more time than I care to remember being with people who have lost their loved ones."
487	0	"So, yes, we have a problem in America."
488	0	We need a president who will stand up against the gun lobby.
489	0	We need a president who will fight for commonsense gun safety reforms.
490	0	(APPLAUSE)
491	0	And what we have here is a big difference.
492	0	Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill five times.
493	0	"He voted for the most important NRA priority, namely giving immunity from liability to gun-makers and dealers, something that is at the root of a lot of the problems that we are facing."
494	0	"Then he doubled down on that in the New York Daily News interview, when asked whether he would support the Sandy Hook parents suing to try to do something to rein in the advertising of the AR-15, which is advertised to young people as being a combat weapon, killing on the battlefield."
495	0	He said they didn't deserve their day in court.
496	0	I could not disagree more.
497	0	"And, finally, this is the only industry in America, the only one."
498	0	(APPLAUSE)
499	0	That has this kind of special protection.
500	0	"We hear a lot from Senator Sanders about the greed and recklessness of Wall Street, and I agree."
501	0	We've got to hold Wall Street accountable...
502	0	... Thank you...
503	0	"... Well, what about the greed and recklessness of gun manufacturers and dealers in America?"
504	0	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
505	0	Senator?
506	0	"Well, the only problem is, Wolf, she didn't answer your question."
507	0	You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible.
508	0	You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible for a lot of the gun violence.
509	0	You made the point what she said was totally absurd.
510	0	"I asked her, are you seriously blaming Vermont and implicitly Senator Sanders for New York's gun violence."
511	0	She said no.
512	0	"But, go ahead."
513	0	Then why did she put out that statement?
514	0	I put it out...
515	0	"... Excuse me, I think I'm responding now."
516	0	"Please, go ahead sir."
517	0	"A statement that was refuted by the governor of the state of Vermont, who was a supporter of hers, who said, yeah, in campaigns people tend to exaggerate."
518	0	Here is the fact on guns.
519	0	Let's talk about guns.
520	0	"That horrible, horrible Sandy Hook -- what's the word we want to use, murder, assault, slaughter, unspeakable act."
521	0	"Back in 1988, I ran for the United States Congress one seat in the state of Vermont."
522	0	"I probably lost that election, which I lost by three points, because I was the only candidate running who said, you know what?"
523	0	"We should ban assault weapons, not seen them sold or distributed in the United States of America."
524	0	I've got a D-minus voting record from the NRA.
525	0	(APPLAUSE)
526	0	"And, in fact, because I come from a state which has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am the best qualified candidate to bring back together that consensus that is desperately needed in this country."
527	0	(APPLAUSE)
528	0	"Thank you, Senator."
529	0	Thank you.
530	0	(CHEERING)
531	0	"Secretary Clinton, I want you to respond to that, but why did you put out that statement blaming Vermont and its gun policy for some of the death of -- by guns in New York?"
532	1	"Well, the facts are that most of the guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from out of state."
533	1	They come from the states that don't have kind of serious efforts to control guns that we do in New York.
534	0	"But let me say this -- in 1988, as we've heard on every debate occasion, Senator Sanders did run for the Congress and he lost."
535	0	"He came back in 1990 and he won, and during that campaign he made a commitment to the NRA that he would be against waiting periods."
536	0	"And, in fact, in his own book, he talks about his 1990 campaign, and here's what he said."
537	0	"He clearly was helped by the NRA, because they ran ads against his opponent."
538	0	"So, then he went to the Congress, where he has been a largely very reliable supporter of the NRA."
539	0	"Voting -- he kept his word to the NRA, he voted against the Brady Bill five times because it had waiting periods in it."
540	0	"Thankfully, enough people finally voted for it to keep guns out of the hands of who should not have them."
541	0	(APPLAUSE)
542	0	"Senator, I want you to respond, but I also want you to respond to this."
543	0	You recently said you do not think crime victims should be able to sue gun makers for damages.
544	0	"The daughter of the Sandy Hook Elementary School who was killed back in the 2012 mass shooting, says you owe her and families an apology."
545	0	Do you?
546	0	What we need to do is to do everything that we can to make certain that guns do not fall into the hands of people who do not have them.
547	0	"Now, I voted against this gun liability law because I was concerned that in rural areas all over this country, if a gun shop owner sells a weapon legally to somebody, and that person then goes out and kills somebody, I don't believe it is appropriate that that gun shop owner who just sold a legal weapon to be held accountable and be sued."
548	0	"But, what I do believe is when gun shop owners and others knowingly are selling weapons to people who should not have them -- somebody walks in."
549	0	"They want thousands of rounds of ammunition, or they want a whole lot of guns, yes, that gun shop owner or that gun manufacturer should be held liable."
550	0	"So, Senator, do you owe the Sandy Hook families an apology?"
551	0	"No, I don't think I owe them an apology."
552	0	"They are in court today, and actually they won a preliminary decision today."
553	0	"They have the right to sue, and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue."
554	0	"Well, I believe that the law that Senator Sanders voted for that I voted against, giving this special protection to gun manufacturers and to dealers, is an absolute abdication of responsibility on the part of those who voted for it."
555	0	"This is a -- this is a unique gift given to only one industry in the world by the United States Congress, as Senator Murphy from Connecticut said, we have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns."
556	0	And the point that Senator Sanders keeps making about how he wouldn't want a mom and pop store -- that was not the point of this.
557	0	"And if he can point to any, any incident where that happened, I would love to hear about it."
558	0	"What was really going on, I'll tell you, because it has a lot to do with New York City."
559	0	New York City was on the brink of being able to hold manufacturers and dealers accountable through a very carefully crafted legal strategy.
560	0	Thank you.
561	0	"The NRA came to their supporters in the Congress and said, stop it, stop it now, and Senator Sanders joined those who did."
562	0	"Thank you, Secretary."
563	0	"Senator, go ahead."
564	0	"Let me just reiterate -- just reiterate so there is no confusion, decades ago, before it was popular, in a rural state with no gun control, Bernie Sanders said, let's ban assault weapons, not see them distributed in the United States of America."
565	0	"Thank you, Senator."
566	0	"Let's turn it over to Errol Lewis, of New York 1 Time Warner Cable News."
567	0	"Secretary Clinton, the 1994 crime bill that you supported added 100,000 police officers across the country and banned certain assault weapons."
568	0	It also imposed tougher prison sentences and eliminated federal funding for inmate education.
569	0	"Looking at the bill as a whole, do you believe it was a net positive or do you think it was a mistake?"
570	0	"Well, I think that it had some positive aspects to it."
571	0	And you mentioned some of them.
572	0	"The Violence Against Women Act, which has been a very important piece of legislation, in my opinion."
573	0	(APPLAUSE)
574	0	And it also did some things which were to provide more opportunities for young people.
575	0	"So if we were to have the balance sheet on one side, there are some positive actions and changes."
576	0	"On the other side, there were decisions that were made that now we must revisit and we have to correct."
577	0	I think that sentences got much too long.
578	0	"The original idea was not that we would increase sentences for non-violent low-level offenders, but once the federal government did what it did, states piled on."
579	0	So we have a problem.
580	0	And the very first speech I gave in this campaign was about what I will do to reform the criminal justice system and end the over-mass incarceration.
581	0	"So I think that if all of us go and look back at where we were, Senator Sanders voted for the crime bill, and he says the same thing, there were some good things, and things that we have to change and learn from."
582	0	So that's how I see it.
583	0	And I think we ought to be putting our attention on forging a consensus to make the changes that will divert more people from the criminal justice system to start.
584	0	"Thank you, Secretary."
585	0	To tackle systemic racism and divert people in the beginning.
586	0	"Now earlier this year, a South Carolina voter told your daughter Chelsea, quote, ""I think a lot of African-Americans want to hear, you know what, we made a mistake."""
587	0	"Chelsea said she has heard you apologize, but went on to say that if the voter hadn't heard it then, quote, ""it's clearly insufficient."""
588	0	Do you regret your advocacy for the crime bill?
589	0	"Well, look, I supported the crime bill."
590	0	My husband has apologized.
591	0	"He was the president who actually signed it, Senator Sanders..."
592	0	"But what about you, Senator?"
593	0	... voted for it.
594	0	I'm sorry for the consequences that were unintended and that have had a very unfortunate impact on people's lives.
595	0	I've seen the results of what has happened in families and in communities.
596	0	"That's why I chose to make my very first speech a year ago on this issue, Errol, because I want to focus the attention of our country and to make the changes we need to make."
597	0	And I also want people...
598	0	(APPLAUSE)
599	0	... especially I want -- I want white people -- I want white people to recognize that there is systemic racism.
600	0	"It's also in employment, it's in housing, but it is in the criminal justice system, as well."
601	0	(APPLAUSE)
602	0	"Senator Sanders, earlier this week at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, you called out President Clinton for defending Secretary Clinton's use of the term super-predator back in the '90s when she supported the crime bill."
603	0	Why did you call him out?
604	0	"Because it was a racist term, and everybody knew it was a racist term."
605	0	(APPLAUSE)
606	0	"Look, much of what Secretary Clinton said was right."
607	0	We had a crime bill.
608	0	I voted for it.
609	0	It had the Violence Against Women Act in it.
610	0	"When as mayor of Burlington, we worked very hard to try to eliminate domestic violence."
611	0	This took us a good step forward.
612	0	We're talking about the weapon that killed the children in Sandy Hook.
613	0	"This banned assault weapons, not insignificant."
614	0	But where we are today is we have a broken criminal justice system.
615	0	We have more people in jail than any other country on Earth.
616	0	"And in my view, what we have got to do is rethink the system from the bottom on up."
617	0	"And that means, for a start -- and we don't talk about this."
618	0	The media doesn't talk about it -- you got 51 percent of African-American kids today who graduated high school who are unemployed or underemployed.
619	0	You know what I think?
620	0	"Maybe we invest in jobs and education for those kids, not jails and incarceration."
621	0	(APPLAUSE)
622	0	And I'll tell you what else.
623	0	And I'll tell you what else I think.
624	0	"And that is, we have got -- and this is the difference between the secretary and myself as I understand it."
625	0	We have got to have the guts to rethink the so-called war on drugs.
626	0	"Too many lives... BLITZER: Thank you, Senator."
627	0	"Too many lives have been destroyed because people possessed marijuana, millions over a 30-year period."
628	0	And that is why I believe we should take marijuana out of the federal Controlled Substance Act.
629	0	(APPLAUSE)
630	0	Thank you.
631	0	Thank you.
632	0	Let's -- let's get Secretary Clinton's response.
633	0	"Well, look, I think that, as Senator Sanders said about what I said, I will say about what he said."
634	0	I think that we recognize that we have a set of problems that we cannot ignore and we must address.
635	0	"And that is why I have been promoting for my entire adult life, I think, the idea of investing early in kids, early childhood education, universal pre-K, like what Mayor de Blasio brought to New York."
636	0	We have got to help more kids get off to a good start.
637	0	"That's why I want a good teacher in a good school for every child, regardless of the ZIP Code that child lives in..."
638	0	Thank you.
639	0	"Thank you, Secretary Clinton."
640	0	(APPLAUSE)
641	0	... and to be really focused on how we build ladders of opportunity and tear down these barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead.
642	0	"Your time's up, Secretary Clinton."
643	0	"Senator Sanders, I have a question for you related to this."
644	0	"So you've said that by the end of your first term as president, the U.S. will no longer lead the world in mass incarceration."
645	0	"To fulfill that promise, you'd have to release roughly half a million prisoners."
646	0	"How are you going to do that, since the vast majority of American prisoners are not under federal jurisdiction?"
647	0	We're going to work with state governments all over this country.
648	0	And you know what?
649	0	"In a very divided Congress, and a very divided politics in America, actually the one area where there is some common ground is conservatives understand that it's insane to be spending $80 billion a year locking up 2.2 million people."
650	0	"With federal and presidential leadership, we will work with state governments to make sure that people are released from jail under strong supervision, that they get the kind of job training and education they need so they can return to their communities."
651	0	"On this one, Errol, actually I think you're going to see progressive and conservative support."
652	0	"We can do it, if we're prepared to be bold."
653	0	"Thank you, Senator."
654	0	"Thank you, Secretary."
655	0	We have to take a quick commercial break.
656	0	We have a lot more questions for Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders right after this.
657	0	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
658	0	Welcome back.
659	0	Let's turn to another critically important issue.
660	0	"Senator, Secretary, the issue of energy and the environment."
661	0	"Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders has said you are in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry."
662	0	You say you're sick and tired of him lying about your record.
663	0	What are his lies?
664	0	"Well, let me start by saying we need to talk about this issue and we should talk about it in terms of the extraordinary threats that climate change pose to our country and our world."
665	0	"And that's why for the last many years, both in the Senate and as secretary of State, it's been a big part of my commitment to see what could be done."
666	0	"But there has never been any doubt that when I was a senator, I tried -- I joined with others to try to get rid of the subsidies for big oil."
667	0	"And I have proposed that again, because that's what I think needs to be done as we transition from fossil fuels to clean energy."
668	0	"And everyone who's looked at this independently, ""The Washington Post"" and others, who give us both hard times when called for on facts, have said that this is absolutely an incorrect false charge."
669	0	"So, we both have relatively small amounts of contributions from people who work for fossil fuel companies."
670	0	Best we can tell from the reports that are done.
671	0	"But, that is not being supported by big oil, and I think it's important to distinguish that."
672	0	"And, let's talk about what each of us has proposed to try to combat greenhouse gas emissions and put us on the fastest track possible to clean energy."
673	0	Thank you.
674	0	"We're going to get to that to, but I want you to respond, Senator."
675	0	"It is one thing, as the Secretary indicated, to talk about workers."
676	0	"I'm sure I have contributions, you have contributions from workers in every industry in the country."
677	1	"But, as I understand it, 43 lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry maxed out, gave the maximum amount of money to Secretary Clinton's campaign."
678	0	(APPLAUSE)
679	0	"Now, that's not saying -- and, then some people say, well, given the hundreds of millions of dollars she raises it's a small amount."
680	0	That's true.
681	0	"But, that does not mean to say that the lobbyists thought she was a pretty good bet on this issue."
682	0	"Now, what I think is when we look at climate change now, we have got to realize that this is a global environmental crisis of unprecedented urgency."
683	0	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
684	0	"And, it is not good enough."
685	0	"You know, if we, God forbid, were attacked tomorrow the whole country would rise up and say we got an enemy out there and we got to do something about it."
686	0	That was what 9/11 was about.
687	0	"We have an enemy out there, and that enemy is going to cause drought and floods and extreme weather disturbances."
688	0	There's going to be international conflict.
689	0	"(APPLAUSE) I am proud, Wolf, that I have introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation..."
690	0	....
691	0	Thank you...
692	0	... Including a tax on carbon.
693	0	Something I don't believe Secretary Clinton supports.
694	0	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
695	0	"Secretary Clinton, go ahead and respond."
696	0	"Well, let's talk about the global environmental crisis."
697	0	"Starting in 2009 as your Secretary of State, I worked with President Obama to bring China and India to the table for the very first time, to get a commitment out of them that they would begin to address their own greenhouse gas emissions."
698	0	(APPLAUSE)
699	0	"I continued to work on that throughout the four years as Secretary of State, and I was very proud that President Obama and America led the way to the agreement that was finally reached in Paris with 195 nations committing to take steps to actually make a difference in climate change."
700	0	(APPLAUSE)
701	0	"And, I was surprised and disappointed when Senator Sanders attacked the agreement, said it was not enough, it didn't go far enough."
702	0	"You know, at some point putting together 195 countries, I know a little bit about that, was a major accomplishment..."
703	0	... Thank you...
704	0	(APPLAUSE CHEERING)
705	0	"... And, our President led the effort to protect our world and he deserve our appreciation, not our criticism..."
706	0	"... Go ahead, Senator..."
707	0	... Let's talk about that.
708	0	"When you were Secretary of State, you also worked hard to expand fracking to countries all over the world."
709	0	(CHEERING)
710	0	"The issue here -- of course the agreement is a step forward, but you know agreements and I know agreements, there's a lot of paper there."
711	0	We've got to get beyond paper right now.
712	0	"We have got to lead the world in transforming our energy system, not tomorrow, but yesterday."
713	0	"(APPLAUSE) And, what that means, Wolf, it means having the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry."
714	0	"Now, I am on board legislation that says, you know what, we ain't going to excavate for fossil fuel on public land."
715	0	That's not Secretary Clinton's position.
716	0	Thank you.
717	0	Let us support a tax on carbon...
718	0	... Secretary Clinton...
719	0	... Not Secretary Clinton's position.
720	0	... Go ahead and respond.
721	0	(APPLAUSE)
722	0	"Well, I'm a little bewildered about how to respond when you have an agreement which gives you the framework to actually take the action that would have only come about because under the Obama administration in the face of implacable hostility from the Republicans in Congress, President Obama moved forward on gas mileage, he moved forward on the clean power plant."
723	0	He has moved forward on so many of the fronts that he could given the executive actions that he was able to take.
724	0	(APPLAUSE)
725	0	"And, you know, I am getting a little bit -- I'm getting a little bit concerned here because, you know, I really believe that the President has done an incredible job against great odds and deserves to be supported."
726	0	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
727	0	"Now, it's easy -- it's easy to diagnose the problem."
728	0	It's harder to do something about the problem.
729	0	And...
730	0	(APPLAUSE)
731	0	"Thank you, Secretary."
732	0	We'll continue on this.
733	0	"Errol -- Errol Louis, go ahead with your question."
734	0	Wolf.
735	0	Wolf.
736	0	We're going to continue on this.
737	0	"Errol, go ahead."
738	0	"OK. Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, you also pioneered a program to promote fracking around the world, as you described."
739	0	"Fracking, of course, a way of extracting natural gas."
740	0	"Now as a candidate for president, you say that by the time you're done with all your rules and regulations, fracking will be restricted in many places around the country."
741	0	Why have you changed your view on fracking?
742	0	"No, well, I don't think I've changed my view on what we need to do to go from where we are, where the world is heavily dependent on coal and oil, but principally coal, to where we need to be, which is clean renewable energy, and one of the bridge fuels is natural gas."
743	0	"And so for both economic and environmental and strategic reasons, it was American policy to try to help countries get out from under the constant use of coal, building coal plants all the time, also to get out from under, especially if they were in Europe, the pressure from Russia, which has been incredibly intense."
744	0	So we did say natural gas is a bridge.
745	0	"We want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible, because in order to deal with climate change, we have got to move as rapidly as we can."
746	0	That's why I've set big goals.
747	0	I want to see us deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term and enough clean energy to provide electricity to every home in America within 10 years.
748	0	(APPLAUSE)
749	0	"So I have big, bold goals, but I know in order to get from where we are, where the world is still burning way too much coal, where the world is still too intimidated by countries and providers like Russia, we have got to make a very firm but decisive move in the direction of clean energy."
750	0	"Thank you, Secretary."
751	0	"All right, Senator?"
752	0	"All right, here is -- here is a real difference."
753	0	"This is a difference between understanding that we have a crisis of historical consequence here, and incrementalism and those little steps are not enough."
754	0	(APPLAUSE)
755	0	Not right now.
756	0	Not on climate change.
757	0	"Now, the truth is, as secretary of state, Secretary Clinton actively supported fracking technology around the world."
758	0	"Second of all, right now, we have got to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet."
759	0	(APPLAUSE)
760	0	And that means -- and I would ask you to respond.
761	0	Are you in favor of a tax on carbon so that we can transit away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy at the level and speed we need to do?
762	0	(APPLAUSE)
763	0	"You know, I have laid out a set of actions that build on what President Obama was able to accomplish, building on the clean power plan, which is currently under attack by fossil fuels and the right in the Supreme Court, which is one of the reasons why we need to get the Supreme Court justice that President Obama has nominated to be confirmed so that we can actually continue to make progress."
764	0	I don't take a back seat to your legislation that you've introduced that you haven't been able to get passed.
765	0	I want to do what we can do to actually make progress in dealing with the crisis.
766	0	That's exactly what I have proposed.
767	0	"OK, thank you, Secretary Clinton."
768	0	And my approach I think is going to get us there faster without tying us up into political knots with a Congress that still would not support what you are proposing.
769	0	(CROSSTALK)
770	0	"Senator Sanders, you've said that climate change is the greatest change to our nation's security."
771	0	Secretary Clinton did not answer one simple question.
772	0	"Excuse me, Senator, Senator, Senator, Senator, Senator..."
773	0	Are you for a tax on carbon or not?
774	0	I have a question for you.
775	0	You've said that climate change is the greatest threat to our nation's security.
776	0	You've called for a nationwide ban on fracking.
777	0	You've also called for phasing out all nuclear power in the U.S.
778	0	"But wouldn't those proposals drive the country back to coal and oil, and actually undermine your fight against global warming?"
779	0	"No, they wouldn't."
780	0	"Look, here's where we are."
781	0	Let me reiterate.
782	0	We have a global crisis.
783	0	Pope Francis reminded us that we are on a suicide course.
784	0	"Our legislation understands, Errol, that there will be economic dislocation."
785	0	It is absolutely true.
786	0	There will be some people who lose their job.
787	0	And we build into our legislation an enormous amount of money to protect those workers.
788	0	It is not their fault...
789	0	It is not their fault that fossil fuels are destroying our climate.
790	0	"But we have got to stand up and say right now, as we would if we were attacked by some military force, we have got to move urgency -- urgently and boldly."
791	0	What does that mean?
792	0	"Senator -- senator, jobs..."
793	0	Yes?
794	0	"-- jobs are one thing, but with less than 6 percent of all U.S. energy coming from solar, wind and geothermal, and 20 percent of U.S. power coming from nuclear, if you phase out all of that, how do you make up..."
795	0	"Well, you don't phase..."
796	0	-- that difference?
797	0	-- it all out tomorrow.
798	0	And you certainly don't phase nuclear out tomorrow.
799	0	But this is what you do do.
800	0	(APPLAUSE)
801	0	What you do do is say that we are going to have a massive program -- and I had introduced -- introduced legislation for 10 million solar rooftops.
802	0	We can put probably millions of people to work retrofitting and weatherizing buildings all over this country.
803	0	(CHEERING)
804	0	Saving -- rebuilding our rail system.
805	0	(APPLAUSE)
806	0	Our mass transit system.
807	0	(APPLAUSE)
808	0	"If we approach this, Errol, as if we were literally at a war -- you know, in 1941, under Franklin Delano Roosevelt, we moved within three years, within three more years to rebuild our economy to defeat Nazism and Japanese imperialism."
809	0	That is exactly the kind of approach we need right now.
810	0	Thank you.
811	0	(APPLAUSE)
812	0	Lead the world.
813	0	"Thank you, Senator."
814	0	(APPLAUSE)
815	0	Let's turn to another critically important issue...
816	0	(APPLAUSE)
817	0	-- the issue of national security and foreign policy.
818	0	"Secretary Clinton, President Obama says the worst mistake in office that he made over these past seven and a half years was not preparing for Libya after Moammar Qadafi was removed."
819	0	You were his secretary of State.
820	0	Aren't you also responsible for that?
821	0	"Well, let me say I think we did a great deal to help the Libyan people after Qadafi's demise."
822	0	And here's what we did.
823	0	"We helped them hold two successful elections, something that is not easy, which they did very well because they had a pent up desire to try to chart their own future after 42 years of dictatorship."
824	0	I was very proud of that.
825	0	"We got rid of the chemical weapons stockpile that Qadafi had, getting it out of Libya, getting it away from militias or terrorist groups."
826	0	We also worked to help them set up their government.
827	0	We sent a lot of American experts there.
828	0	"We offered to help them secure their borders, to train a new military."
829	0	"They, at the end, when it came to security issues, Wolf, did not want troops from any other country, not just us, European or other countries, in Libya."
830	0	And so we were caught in a very difficult position.
831	0	"They could not provide security on their own, which we could see and we told them that, but they didn't want to have others helping to provide that security."
832	0	"And the result has been a clash between different parts of the country, terrorists taking up some locations in the country."
833	0	And we can't walk away from that.
834	0	We need to be working with European and Arab partners...
835	0	Thank you.
836	0	-- with the United Nations in order to continue to try to support them.
837	0	The Libyan people deserve a chance at democracy and self- government.
838	0	"And I, as president, will keep trying to give that to them"
839	0	"Senator, go ahead."
840	0	"According to ""The New York Times."
841	0	(APPLAUSE)
842	0	"for President Obama, this was a pretty tough call, like a 51-49 call, do you overthrow Qadafi, who, of course, was a horrific dictator?"
843	0	"The New York Times"" told us it was Secretary Clinton who led the effect for that regime change."
844	0	And this is the same type of mentality that supported the war in Iraq.
845	0	(APPLAUSE)
846	0	Look...
847	0	(APPLAUSE)
848	0	"-- Qadafi, Saddam Hussein are brutal, brutal murdering thugs."
849	0	No debate about that.
850	0	But what we have got to do and what the president was saying is we didn't think thoroughly about what happens the day after you get rid of these dictators.
851	0	"Regime change often has unintended consequences in Iraq and in Libya right now, where ISIS has a very dangerous foothold."
852	0	And I think if you studied the whole history of...
853	0	Yes.
854	0	"-- American involvement in regime change, you see that quite often."
855	0	"Secretary, we're going to let you respond."
856	0	(APPLAUSE)
857	0	"Yes, well, I..."
858	0	(APPLAUSE)
859	0	-- I...
860	0	(APPLAUSE)
861	1	"-- I -- I would just point out that there was a vote in the Senate as to whether or not the United States should support the efforts by the Libyan people to protect themselves against the threats, the genocidal threats coming from Gadhafi, and whether we should go to the United Nations to seek Security Council support."
862	1	"Senator Sanders voted for that, and that's exactly what we did."
863	0	No.
864	0	(CROSSTALK)
865	0	"We went to the United Nations -- yes, he did."
866	0	We went to the United Nations Security Council.
867	0	We got support from the Security Council.
868	0	And we then supported the efforts of our European and Arab allies and partners.
869	0	This was a request made to our government by the Europeans and by the Arabs because of their great fear of what chaos in Syria would do to them.
870	0	"And if you want to know what chaos does, not just to the people inside but the people on the borders, look at Syria."
871	0	"Nobody stood up to Assad and removed him, and we have had a far greater disaster in Syria than we are currently dealing with right now in Libya."
872	0	(APPLAUSE)
873	0	(CROSSTALK)
874	0	"Senator, go ahead."
875	0	Secretary Clinton made this charge in previous debates and just repeating it doesn't make it truer.
876	0	"What you are talking about is what I think was what they call the unanimous consent, you know what that is, where basically, do we support Libya moving to democracy?"
877	1	"Well, you know what, I surely have always supported Libya moving to democracy."
878	1	But please do not confuse that with your active effort for regime change without contemplating what happened the day after.
879	0	Totally different issue.
880	0	"Well, that isn't..."
881	0	"Second of all -- second of all, if I might, in terms of Syria, in terms of Syria..."
882	0	"Senator, let her respond to that, then we'll get to that."
883	0	"Go ahead, Secretary."
884	0	"There was also in that a reference to the Security Council, and I know you're not shy when you oppose something, Senator."
885	0	"So, yes, it was unanimous."
886	0	"That's exactly right, including you."
887	0	And what we did was to try to provide support for our European and Arab allies and partners.
888	0	The decision was the president's.
889	0	Did I do the due diligence?
890	0	Did I talk to everybody I could talk to?
891	0	Did I visit every capital and then report back to the president?
892	0	"Yes, I did."
893	0	That's what a secretary of state does.
894	0	"But at the end of the day, those are the decisions that are made by the president to in any way use American military power."
895	0	And the president made that decision.
896	0	"And, yes, we did try without success because of the Libyans' obstruction to our efforts, but we did try and we will continue to try to help the Libyan people."
897	0	"Thank you, Secretary."
898	0	"Go ahead, Senator."
899	0	"If you listen, you know -- two points."
900	0	"Number one, yes, 100-0 in the Senate voted for democracy in Libya and I would vote for that again."
901	0	But that is very different from getting actively involved to overthrow and bring about regime change without fully understanding what the consequence of that regime change would be.
902	0	"Second of all, I know you keep referring to Barack Obama all night here, but you in Syria, you in Syria talked about a no-fly zone, which the president certainly does not support, nor do I support because, A, it will cost an enormous sum of money, second of all, it runs the risk of getting us sucked into perpetual warfare in that region."
903	0	"Thirdly, when we talk about Syria right now, no debate, like Gadhafi, like Saddam Hussein, Assad is another brutal murdering dictator, but right now our fight is to destroy ISIS first, and to get rid of Assad second."
904	0	"Well, I think Senator Sanders has just reinforced my point."
905	0	"Yes, when I was secretary of state I did urge, along with the Department of Defense and the CIA that we seek out, vet, and train, and arm Syrian opposition figures so that they could defend themselves against Assad."
906	0	The president said no.
907	0	"Now, that's how it works."
908	0	People who work for the president make recommendations and then the president makes the decision.
909	0	So I think it's only fair to look at where we are in Syria today.
910	0	"And, yes, I do still support a no-fly zone because I think we need to put in safe havens for those poor Syrians who are fleeing both Assad and ISIS and have some place that they can be safe."
911	0	"Staying on national security, Dana Bash has a question."
912	0	"Senator Sanders, in 1997, you said this about NATO, you said, quote: ""It is not the time to continue wasting tens of billions of dollars helping to defend Europe, let alone assuming more than our share of any cost associated with expanding NATO."""
913	0	Do you still feel that way?
914	0	"Well, what I believe, if my memory is correct here, we spend about 75 percent of the entire cost of the military aspect of NATO."
915	0	"Given the fact that France has a very good health care system and free public education, college education for their people, the U.K. has a good National Health Service and they also provide fairly reasonable higher education, you know what, yeah, I do believe that the countries of Europe should pick up more of the burden for their defense."
916	0	"Yes, I do."
917	0	(APPLAUSE)
918	0	"And just following up, Senator Sanders, Donald Trump also argues that NATO is unfair economically to the U.S. because America pays a disproportionate share."
919	0	So how is what you say about NATO and your proposal different than his?
920	0	"Well, you got to ask -- you got to ask Trump."
921	0	"All I can tell you is, with a huge deficit, with 47 million people living in poverty, with our inner cities collapsing, yeah, I do think countries like Germany and U.K. and France and European countries whose economy, or at least its standard of living and health care and education, they're doing pretty well."
922	0	"So I would not be embarrassed as president of the United States to stay to our European allies, you know what, the United States of America cannot just support your economies."
923	0	You got to put up your own fair share of the defense burden.
924	0	Nothing wrong with that.
925	0	(APPLAUSE)
926	0	Secretary Clinton?
927	0	I support our continuing involvement in NATO.
928	0	And it is important to ask for our NATO allies to pay more of the cost.
929	0	"There is a requirement that they should be doing so, and I believe that needs to be enforced."
930	0	But there's a larger question here.
931	0	NATO has been the most successful military alliance in probably human history.
932	0	"It has bound together across the Atlantic countries that are democracies, that have many of the same values and interests, and now we need to modernize it and move it into the 21st century to serve as that head of our defense operations in Europe when it comes to terrorism and other threats that we face."
933	0	So...
934	0	"But, Madam Secretary... CLINTON: ... yes, of course they should be paying more, but that doesn't mean if they don't we leave, because I don't think that's in America's interests."
935	0	"That's going to be part of my -- my question to you is, to that point, there are 28 countries in the alliance, and the United States gives more money to NATO's budget than 21 of those countries combined."
936	0	"If they don't agree to pay more, as you suggested, then what would you do as commander-in-chief?"
937	0	I will stay in NATO.
938	0	"I will stay in NATO, and we will continue to look for missions and other kinds of programs that they will support."
939	0	"Remember, NATO was with us in Afghanistan."
940	0	Most of the member countries also lost soldiers and civilians in Afghanistan.
941	0	They came to our rallying defense after 9/11.
942	0	That meant a lot.
943	0	"And, yes, we have to work out the financial aspects of it, but let's not forget what's really happening."
944	0	"With Russia being more aggressive, making all kinds of intimidating moves toward the Baltic countries, we've seen what they've done in Eastern Ukraine, we know how they want to rewrite the map of Europe, it is not in our interests."
945	0	Think of how much it would cost if Russia's aggression were not deterred because NATO was there on the front lines making it clear they could not move forward.
946	0	(APPLAUSE)
947	0	"Thank you, Secretary."
948	0	"Senator, let's talk about the U.S. relationship with Israel."
949	0	"Senator Sanders, you maintained that Israel's response in Gaza in 2014 was, quote, ""disproportionate and led to the unnecessary loss of innocent life."""
950	0	(APPLAUSE)
951	0	What do you say to those who believe that Israel has a right to defend itself as it sees fit?
952	0	"Well, as somebody who spent many months of my life when I was a kid in Israel, who has family in Israel, of course Israel has a right not only to defend themselves, but to live in peace and security without fear of terrorist attack."
953	0	That is not a debate.
954	0	(APPLAUSE)
955	0	"But -- but what you just read, yeah, I do believe that."
956	0	"Israel was subjected to terrorist attacks, has every right in the world to destroy terrorism."
957	0	"But we had in the Gaza area -- not a very large area -- some 10,000 civilians who were wounded and some 1,500 who were killed."
958	0	MEMBER Free Palestine!
959	0	"Now, if you're asking not just me, but countries all over the world was that a disproportionate attack, the answer is that I believe it was, and let me say something else."
960	0	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
961	0	"And, let me say something else."
962	0	"As somebody who is 100% pro-Israel, in the long run -- and this is not going to be easy, God only knows, but in the long run if we are ever going to bring peace to that region which has seen so much hatred and so much war, we are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity."
963	0	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
964	0	"So what is not to say -- to say that right now in Gaza, right now in Gaza unemployment is s somewhere around 40%."
965	0	"You got a log of that area continues, it hasn't been built, decimated, houses decimated health care decimated, schools decimated."
966	0	I believe the United States and the rest of the world have got to work together to help the Palestinian people.
967	0	That does not make me anti-Israel.
968	0	"That paves the way, I think..."
969	0	"... Thank you, Senator..."
970	0	...to an approach that works in the Middle East.
971	0	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
972	0	Thank you.
973	0	"Secretary Clinton, do you agree with Senator Sanders that Israel overreacts to Palestinians attacks, and that in order for there to be peace between Israel and the Palestinians, Israel must, quote, end its disproportionate responses?"
974	0	I negotiated the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in November of 2012.
975	0	I did it in concert with...
976	0	(APPLAUSE)
977	0	"President Abbas of the Palestinian authority based in Ramallah, I did it with the then Muslim Brotherhood President, Morsi, based in Cairo, working closely with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli cabinet."
978	0	I can tell you right now I have been there with Israeli officials going back more than 25 years that they do not seek this kind of attacks.
979	0	They do not invite the rockets raining down on their towns and villages.
980	0	(APPLAUSE)
981	0	They do not believe that there should be a constant incitement by Hamas aided and abetted by Iran against Israel.
982	0	"And, so when it came time after they had taken the incoming rockets, taken the assaults and ambushes on their soldiers and they called and told me, I was in Cambodia, that they were getting ready to have to invade Gaza again because they couldn't find anybody to talk to tell them to stop it, I flew all night, I got there, I negotiated that."
983	0	"So, I don't know how you run a country when you are under constant threat, terrorist tact, rockets coming at you."
984	0	You have a right to defend yourself.
985	0	(APPLAUSE)
986	0	That does not mean -- that does not mean that you don't take appropriate precautions.
987	0	"And, I understand that there's always second guessing anytime there is a war."
988	0	"It also does not mean that we should not continue to do everything we can to try to reach a two-state solution, which would give the Palestinians the rights and..."
989	0	... Thank you...
990	0	... just let me finish.
991	0	The rights and the autonomy that they deserve.
992	0	"And, let me say this, if Yasser Arafat had agreed with my husband at Camp David in the Late 1990s to the offer then Prime Minister Barat put on the table, we would have had a Palestinian state for 15 years."
993	0	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
994	0	"Thank you, Senator, go ahead -- go ahead, Senator."
995	0	I don't think that anybody would suggest that Israel invites and welcomes missiles flying into their country.
996	0	That is not the issue.
997	0	"And, you evaded the answer."
998	0	You evaded the question.
999	0	"The question is not does Israel have a right to respond, nor does Israel have a right to go after terrorists and destroy terrorism."
1000	0	That's not the debate.
1001	0	Was their response disproportionate?
1002	0	"I believe that it was, you have not answered that."
1003	0	(CHEERING)
1004	0	I will certainly be willing to answer it.
1005	0	"I think I did answer it by saying that of course there have to be precautions taken but even the most independent analyst will say the way that Hamas places its weapons, the way that it often has its fighters in civilian garb, it is terrible."
1006	0	(AUDIENCE REACTION)
1007	0	I'm not saying it's anything other than terrible.
1008	0	"It would be great -- remember, Israel left Gaza."
1009	0	They took out all the Israelis.
1010	0	They turned the keys over to the Palestinian people.
1011	0	And what happened?
1012	0	Hamas took over Gaza.
1013	0	"So instead of having a thriving economy with the kind of opportunities that the children of the Palestinians deserve, we have a terrorist haven that is getting more and more rockets shipped in from Iran and elsewhere."
1014	0	"Thank you, Secretary."
1015	0	Senator.
1016	0	I read Secretary Clinton's statement speech before AIPAC.
1017	0	I heard virtually no discussion at all about the needs of the Palestinian people.
1018	0	Almost none in that speech.
1019	0	(APPLAUSE)
1020	0	"So here is the issue: of course Israel has a right to defend itself, but long term there will never be peace in that region unless the United States plays a role, an even-handed role trying to bring people together and recognizing the serious problems that exist among the Palestinian people."
1021	0	That is what I believe the world wants to us do and that's the kind of leadership that we have got to exercise.
1022	0	"Well, if I -- I want to add, you know, again describing the problem is a lot easier than trying to solve it."
1023	0	"And I have been involved, both as first lady with my husband's efforts, as a senator supporting the efforts that even the Bush administration was undertaking, and as secretary of state for President Obama, I'm the person who held the last three meetings between the president of the Palestinian Authority and the prime minister of Israel."
1024	0	"There were only four of us in the room, Netanyahu, Abbas, George Mitchell, and me."
1025	0	Three long meetings.
1026	0	And I was absolutely focused on what was fair and right for the Palestinians.
1027	0	I was absolutely focused on what we needed to do to make sure that the Palestinian people had the right to self-government.
1028	0	"And I believe that as president I will be able to continue to make progress and get an agreement that will be fair both to the Israelis and the Palestinians without ever, ever undermining Israel's security."
1029	0	(APPLAUSE)
1030	0	"A final word, Senator, go ahead."
1031	0	"There comes a time -- there comes a time when if we pursue justice and peace, we are going to have to say that Netanyahu is not right all of the time."
1032	0	(APPLAUSE)
1033	0	Well...
1034	0	Secretary.
1035	0	"... you know, I have spoken about and written at some length the very candid conversations I've had with him and other Israeli leaders."
1036	0	"Nobody is saying that any individual leader is always right, but it is a difficult position."
1037	0	"If you are from whatever perspective trying to seek peace, trying to create the conditions for peace when there is a terrorist group embedded in Gaza that does not want to see you exist, that is a very difficult challenge."
1038	0	"Senator, go ahead."
1039	1	"You gave a major speech to AIPAC, which obviously deals with the Middle East crisis, and you barely mentioned the Palestinians."
1040	0	"And I think, again, it is a complicated issue and God knows for decades presidents, including President Clinton and others, Jimmy Carter and others have tried to do the right thing."
1041	0	All that I am saying is we cannot continue to be one-sided.
1042	0	There are two sides to the issue.
1043	0	"Thank you, Senator."
1044	0	"Thank you, Secretary."
1045	0	"We have to take another quick, quick break."
1046	0	"But much more on the CNN Democratic presidential debate live from Brooklyn, New York."
1047	0	That is coming up right after this.
1048	0	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
1049	0	Welcome back to the CNN presidential debate.
1050	0	We're here in Brooklyn.
1051	0	"Secretary, Senator, both of you talk about major reforms to college tuition, health care, and Social Security, all of which will take significant changes from Congress, currently controlled by Republicans."
1052	0	"Senator Sanders, you're promising health care and free college for all, and those plans would be met with both political and practical challenges."
1053	0	"The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says your initiatives would cost up to $28 trillion and, even after massive tax increases, that would add as much as $15 trillion to the national debt."
1054	0	How is this fiscally responsible?
1055	0	"Well, first of all, I disagree with that study."
1056	0	"There are many economists who come up with very, very different numbers."
1057	0	"For example, we are the only country, major country on Earth, that does not guarantee health care to all people, and yet we end up spending almost three times what the British do, 50 percent more than the French."
1058	0	"My proposal, a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program, will save..."
1059	0	(APPLAUSE)
1060	0	... will save middle-class families many thousands of dollars a year in their health care costs.
1061	0	Public colleges and universities tuition free?
1062	0	Damn right.
1063	0	That is exactly what we should be doing.
1064	0	(APPLAUSE)
1065	0	"And I'd pay for that -- I'd pay for that by telling Wall Street that, yeah, we are going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation, which will bring in more than enough money to provide free tuition at public colleges and universities and lower the outrageous level of student debt."
1066	0	"Wolf, we have seen in the last 30 years a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent."
1067	0	"The establishment does not like this idea, but, yes, I am determined to transfer that money back to the working families of this country."
1068	0	(APPLAUSE)
1069	0	"Thank you, Senator."
1070	0	"Secretary, go ahead and respond."
1071	0	"Well, again -- again, I absolutely agree with the diagnosis, the diagnosis that we've got to do much more to finish the work of getting universal health care coverage, something that I've worked on for 25 years."
1072	0	"Before there was something called Obamacare, there was something called Hillarycare."
1073	0	And we're now at 90 percent of coverage; I'm going to get us to 100 percent.
1074	0	"And with respect to college, I think we have to make college affordable."
1075	0	"We are pricing out middle-class, working, and poor families."
1076	0	There's no doubt about that.
1077	0	"But I do think when you make proposals and you're running for president, you should be held accountable for whether or not the numbers add up and whether or not the plans..."
1078	0	(APPLAUSE)
1079	0	... are actually going to work.
1080	0	"And just very briefly, on health care, most of the people who have analyzed what Senator Sanders put out -- remember, he had a plan for about, I don't know, 18, 20 years."
1081	0	He changed in the middle of this campaign.
1082	0	He put out another plan.
1083	0	People have been analyzing the new plan.
1084	0	"And there is no doubt by those who have analyzed it, progressive economists, health economists, and the like, that it would pose an incredible burden, not just on the budget, but on individuals."
1085	0	"In fact, the Washington Post called it a train-wreck for the poor."
1086	0	"A working woman on Medicaid who already has health insurance would be expected to pay about $2,300."
1087	0	The same for free college.
1088	0	"The free college offer -- you know, my late father said, if somebody promises you something for free, read the fine print."
1089	0	"You read the fine print, and here's what it says."
1090	0	"Thank you, Secretary."
1091	0	"The fine print says this, that it will -- the federal government will cover two-thirds of the cost and require the states, even those led by Republican governors..."
1092	0	"Senator, go ahead."
1093	0	Thank you.
1094	0	... to carry out what the remaining one-third of the cost.
1095	0	I know what Secretary Clinton is saying.
1096	0	Secretary please.
1097	0	We are not a country that has the courage to stand up to big money and do what has to be done for the working families of the country.
1098	0	(APPLAUSE)
1099	0	"Secretary Clinton will have to explain to the people of our country how it could be that every other major country on Earth manages to guarantee health care to all of their people, spending significantly less per capita than we can."
1100	0	"I live 50 miles away from Canada, you know?"
1101	0	It's not some kind of communist authoritarian country.
1102	0	They're doing OK.
1103	0	They got a health care system that guarantees health care to all people.
1104	0	We can do the same.
1105	0	"In terms of public colleges and universities, please don't tell me that we cannot do what many other countries around the world are doing."
1106	0	"Kids should not be punished and leave school deeply in debt, for what crime?"
1107	0	For trying to get an education.
1108	0	"Thank you, Senator."
1109	0	"So, yes, we are going to pay for it..."
1110	0	Well...
1111	0	"Secretary Clinton -- Secretary Clinton, go ahead."
1112	0	We have -- we have a difference of opinion.
1113	0	We both want to get to universal health care coverage.
1114	0	"I did stand up to the special interests and the powerful forces, the health insurance companies and the drug companies."
1115	0	(APPLAUSE)
1116	0	"And perhaps that's why I am so much in favor of supporting President Obama's signature accomplishment with the Affordable Care Act, because I know how hard it was to get that passed, even with a Democratic Congress."
1117	0	"So rather than letting the Republicans repeal it or rather starting all over again, trying to throw the country into another really contentious debate, let's make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody..."
1118	0	"Thank you, Secretary."
1119	0	"... let's get to 100 percent coverage, let's get the cost down, and let's guarantee health care."
1120	0	"Secretary, let's talk about Social Security, another critically important issue."
1121	0	Senator Sanders has challenged you to give a clear answer when it comes to extending the life of Social Security and expanding benefits.
1122	0	"Are you prepared to lift the cap on taxable income, which currently stands at $118,500?"
1123	0	"Yes or no, would you lift the cap?"
1124	0	"I have said repeatedly, Wolf, I am going to make the wealthy pay into Social Security to extend the Social Security Trust Fund."
1125	0	That is one way.
1126	0	"If that is the way that we pursue, I will follow that."
1127	0	But there are other ways.
1128	0	We should be looking at taxing passive income by wealthy people.
1129	0	We should be looking at taxing all of their investment.
1130	0	"But here's the real issue, because I -- I've heard this, I've seen the reports of it."
1131	0	"I have said from the very beginning, we are going to protect Social Security."
1132	0	I was one of the leaders in the fight against Bush when he was trying to privatize Social Security.
1133	0	"But we also, in addition to extending the Trust Fund, which I am absolutely determined to do, we've got to help people who are not being taken care of now."
1134	0	"And because Social Security started in the 1930s, a lot of women have been left out and left behind."
1135	0	"And it's time that we provide more benefits for widows, divorcees, for caregivers, for women who deserve more from the Social Security..."
1136	0	"Thank you, Secretary."
1137	0	-- system and that will be my highest priority.
1138	0	Senator?
1139	0	"Go ahead, Senator."
1140	0	(APPLAUSE)
1141	0	"An interesting comment, but you didn't answer the question."
1142	0	I did.
1143	0	If that's the way we're...
1144	0	"No, you didn't."
1145	0	My legi...
1146	0	"-- yes, I did."
1147	0	Can I answer...
1148	0	I did answer the...
1149	0	-- may I please...
1150	0	"Well, don't -- don't put words..."
1151	0	-- can I have... (CROSSTALK)
1152	0	-- into my mouth and say something...
1153	0	-- do I not?
1154	0	-- that's not accurate.
1155	0	"Go ahead, Senator."
1156	0	All right.
1157	0	"Essentially what you described is my legislation, which includes (INAUDIBLE)..."
1158	0	(APPLAUSE)
1159	0	"Now, we've got -- here is the issue."
1160	0	Your answer has been the same year after year.
1161	0	"In fact, the idea that I'm bringing forth, I have to admit it, you know, it wasn't my idea."
1162	0	"It was Barack Obama's idea in 2008, the exact same idea."
1163	0	(APPLAUSE)
1164	0	"He called for lifting the cap, which is now higher -- it's at 118 -- and starting at 250 and going on up."
1165	0	"If you do that, you're going to extend the life of Social Security for 58 years."
1166	0	"You will significantly expand benefits by 1,300 bucks a year for seniors and disabled vets under $16,000 a year."
1167	0	What's wrong with that?
1168	0	Are you prepared to support it?
1169	0	I have supported it.
1170	0	"You know, we are in vigorous agreement here, Senator."
1171	0	You have sup...
1172	0	I think it's important...
1173	0	(APPLAUSE)
1174	0	-- to point out that...
1175	0	(APPLAUSE)
1176	0	"-- you know, we're -- we're having a discussion about the best way to raise money from wealthy people to extend the Social Security Trust Fund."
1177	0	Think about what the other side wants to do.
1178	0	They're calling Social Security a Ponzi scheme.
1179	0	They still want to privatize it.
1180	0	"In fact, their whole idea is to turn over the Social Security Trust Fund to Wall Street, something you and I would never let happen."
1181	0	"All right, so..."
1182	0	"So, yes, we both want to make sure..."
1183	0	(APPLAUSE)
1184	0	"Look, Wolf..."
1185	0	-- Social Security (INAUDIBLE)...
1186	0	-- I am very glad that...
1187	0	(CROSSTALK)
1188	0	-- and well-funded...
1189	0	I am very glad to...
1190	0	(CROSSTALK)
1191	0	"Thank you, Secretary."
1192	0	(CROSSTALK)
1193	0	"Senator, go ahead."
1194	0	"-- campaign of challenging, if I hear you correctly, Madam Secretary, you are now coming out finally in favor of lifting the cap on taxable income..."
1195	0	(APPLAUSE)
1196	0	-- and extending and expanding Social Security.
1197	0	"If that is the case, welcome on board."
1198	0	I'm glad you're here.
1199	0	(APPLAUSE)
1200	0	No.
1201	0	Thank you.
1202	0	"Errol -- Errol Louis, go ahead."
1203	0	(APPLAUSE)
1204	0	We are going...
1205	0	(APPLAUSE)
1206	0	-- we are...
1207	0	(APPLAUSE)
1208	0	-- we are going...
1209	0	Secretary...
1210	0	"I -- as he said, I've said the same thing for years."
1211	0	I didn't say anything different tonight.
1212	0	We are going to extend the Social Security Trust Fund.
1213	0	There is still something called Congress.
1214	0	"Now, I happen to support Democrats and I want to get Democrats to take back the majority in the United States Senate..."
1215	0	Errol...
1216	0	-- so a lot of -- a lot of what we're talking about can actually be implemented...
1217	0	"Errol, hold on a second."
1218	0	-- when I am president.
1219	0	Secretary...
1220	0	Go ahead.
1221	0	"Hold on, Errol..."
1222	0	-- I'm still...
1223	0	-- Errol.
1224	0	Hold on.
1225	0	I've got to admit...
1226	0	"Go ahead, Senator."
1227	0	-- maybe I'm a little bit confused.
1228	0	Are you or are you not supporting legislation to lift the cap on taxable income and expand Social Security for 58 years and increase benefits...
1229	0	I am...
1230	0	-- yes or no?
1231	0	"I have said yes, we are going to pick the best way or combination..."
1232	0	"Oh, you -- ah."
1233	0	(APPLAUSE)
1234	0	(BOOS)
1235	0	OK.
1236	0	-- or combination of ways...
1237	0	(BOOS)
1238	0	-- you know...
1239	0	(BOOS)
1240	0	"-- it -- it's all -- it's always a little bit, uh, challenging because, you know, if Senator Sanders doesn't agree with how you are approaching something, then you are a member of the establishment."
1241	0	"Well, let me say then..."
1242	0	"Well, look..."
1243	0	(APPLAUSE)
1244	0	-- let me say this...
1245	0	(APPLAUSE)
1246	0	-- we are going to extend the Social Security Trust Fund.
1247	0	We've got some good ideas to do it.
1248	0	Let's get a Congress elected...
1249	0	Thank you.
1250	0	-- that will actually agree...
1251	0	"Well, thank you..."
1252	0	-- with us in doing it.
1253	0	"Errol, go ahead."
1254	0	"OK, Secretary Clinton, I've got a question for you from a reader..."
1255	0	(CROSSTALK)
1256	0	Let me interject here.
1257	0	"-- of the ""New York Daily News."""
1258	0	"Yes, Secretary Clinton..."
1259	0	(CROSSTALK)
1260	0	-- you are a member of the establishment.
1261	0	-- this was a reader...
1262	0	(INAUDIBLE).
1263	0	"-- of ""The Daily News"" who sent us a..."
1264	0	(CHEERING)
1265	0	-- a question for you.
1266	0	"Just a second, Senator."
1267	0	"Hannah Green (ph) wants to know your position, Secretary Clinton, regarding President Obama's nomination of Merrick Gaarland to the Supreme m Court."
1268	0	"President Obama said earlier this week that he would not withdraw the nomination, even after the presidential election."
1269	0	"If elected, would you ask the president to withdraw the nomination?"
1270	0	I am not going to contradict the president's strategy on this.
1271	0	And I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals.
1272	0	I fully support the president.
1273	0	(APPLAUSE)
1274	0	And I believe that the president -- the president is on the right side of both the Constitution and history.
1275	0	And the Senate needs to immediately begin to respond.
1276	0	So I'm going to support the president.
1277	0	"When I am president, I will take stock of where we are and move from there."
1278	0	Senator Sanders.
1279	0	"Well, there is no question."
1280	0	"I mean, it really is an outrage."
1281	0	"And it just continues, the seven-and-a-half years of unbelievable obstructionism we have seen from these right-wing Republicans."
1282	0	"I mean, a third-grader in America understands the president of the United States has the right to nominate individuals to the U.S. Supreme Court."
1283	0	Apparently everybody understands that except the Republicans in Congress.
1284	0	"So, Senator Sanders, would you ask him to withdraw the nomination?"
1285	0	"Yes, but here is the point, and obviously i will strongly support that nomination as a member of the Senate."
1286	0	"But, if elected president, I would ask the president to withdraw that nomination because I think -- I think this."
1287	0	"I think that we need a Supreme Court justice who will make it crystal clear, and this nominee has not yet done that, crystal clear that he or she will vote to overturn Citizens United and make sure that American democracy is not undermined."
1288	0	CLINTON "You know, there is no doubt that the only people that I would ever appoint to the Supreme Court are people who believe that Roe V. Wade is settled law and Citizens United needs to be overturned."
1289	0	CLINTON And I want to say something about this since we're talking about the Supreme Court and what's at stake.
1290	0	CLINTON "We've had eight debates before, this is our ninth."
1291	0	CLINTON "We've not had one question about a woman's right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, not one question."
1292	0	(APPLAUSE)
1293	0	"And in the meantime we have states, governors doing everything they can to restrict women's rights."
1294	0	We have a presidential candidate by the name of Donald Trump saying that women should be punished.
1295	0	And we are never asked about this.
1296	0	"And to be complete in my concern, Senator Sanders says with respect to Trump it was a distraction."
1297	0	I don't think it's a distraction.
1298	0	"It goes to the heart of who we are as women, our rights, our autonomy, our ability to make our own decisions, and we need to be talking about that and defending Planned Parenthood from these outrageous attacks."
1299	0	"Senator Sanders, your response."
1300	0	"You're looking at a senator and former congressman who proudly has a 100 percent pro-choice voting record, who will take on those Republican governors who are trying to restrict a woman's right to choose, who will take on those governors right now who are discriminating outrageously against the LGBT community, who comes from a state which led the effort for gay marriage in this country, proudly so."
1301	0	(APPLAUSE)
1302	0	"Thank you, Senator."
1303	0	"Who not only thinks we are not going to -- not defund Planned Parenthood, we've got to expand funding for Planned Parenthood."
1304	0	(APPLAUSE)
1305	0	"Senator Sanders, you've spoken a lot tonight about your votes in Congress."
1306	0	"You have been in Congress for over a quarter of the century, and there as an independent, not a Democrat."
1307	0	"Now you're seeking the Democratic nomination, but Secretary Clinton has suggested that she's not even sure you are a Democrat."
1308	0	Are you?
1309	0	"Well, why would I be running for the Democratic nomination to be president of the United States?"
1310	0	SANDERS But here is a good point.
1311	0	SANDERS "You know, in virtually all of the general election match-up polls between Trump and Secretary Clinton and Trump and Bernie Sanders, in almost all of those polls, I do better than Secretary Clinton both in the CNN poll I was 20 points ahead of Trump."
1312	0	SANDERS I think Secretary Clinton was 12 points.
1313	0	SANDERS And you know why?
1314	0	SANDERS "Because in fact a whole lot of people -- this may be a shock to the secretary, but there a whole lot of independents in this country."
1315	0	(APPLAUSE)
1316	0	Senator Sanders...
1317	0	And we are not going to win the White House based on just long-term Democratic votes.
1318	0	We have got to reach out to independents and I think I am well qualified to do that.
1319	0	Senator Sanders.
1320	0	(APPLAUSE)
1321	0	I am in this race as a Democrat.
1322	0	I have raised millions of dollars for my colleagues in the United States Senate to help them get elected.
1323	0	I will do everything I can to open the Democratic party to the young people who are flocking into our political campaign.
1324	0	(CHEERING)
1325	0	"On that very subject, on that very subject, Secretary Clinton mentions electing a Democratic congress several times."
1326	0	She says that she raised $15 million for the Democratic party in the first three months of this year.
1327	0	You don't appear to have raised any money for the party.
1328	0	Yesterday you did announce that you will help three members of Congress who have endorsed you.
1329	0	Why aren't you doing more to help the party you say you want to lead?
1330	0	"The truth is, and you can speak to my colleagues, we have raised millions of dollars to the DSCC."
1331	0	"I have written letter that have raised, if I may use the word, huge amount of money so that's just not accurate."
1332	0	"But, I will also say, and this is important and maybe the Secretary disagrees with me, but I am proud that millions of young people who previously were not involved in the political process are now coming into it, and I do believe, I do believe that we have got to open the door of the Democratic party to those people."
1333	0	(APPLAUSE)
1334	0	"And, I think the future of the Democratic party is not simply by raising money from wealthy campaign contributors."
1335	0	I think that the way we are doing it in this campaign...
1336	0	... Thank you Senator.
1337	0	$27 a contribution...
1338	0	"... Senator, your time is up..."
1339	0	"SANDERS; not being dependent on Wall Street, or big money, that is the future of the Democratic Party that I want to see."
1340	0	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
1341	0	"Thank you, Senator Sanders."
1342	0	Secretary Clinton.
1343	0	Let us talk about where we are in this race.
1344	0	I've gotten more votes than anybody running.
1345	0	9.6 million at the last count.
1346	0	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
1347	0	That is 2.3 million more than Senator Sanders.
1348	0	(APPLAUSE)
1349	0	And it is 1.4 million more than Donald Trump.
1350	0	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
1351	0	I think you have to look at the facts.
1352	0	"And, the facts are that I'm putting together a very broad-based, inclusive coalition from the South to the North, from the East to the West, with African-American, Latinos, women, union households, working people and I am very proud of the campaign we are running."
1353	0	"It is a campaign that will not only capture the Democratic nomination, but a campaign that will defeat whoever the Republican end up nominating."
1354	0	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
1355	0	"Thank you, Madam Secretary."
1356	0	Senator Sanders.
1357	0	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
1358	0	"And, I want to say -- I also want to say that I do -- I do think it is absolutely critical and incredible that we have so many young people involved in the political process."
1359	0	"I applaud all of those who are applauding you, Senator Sanders."
1360	0	"We're happy that they are supporting you, that they are passionately committed to you and to the issues."
1361	0	"But, let me also say it's going to be important that we unify the Democratic party when the nomination process has been completed..."
1362	0	"... Secretary Clinton, thank you."
1363	0	"And, I know something about that..."
1364	0	... Secretary Clinton...
1365	0	Thank you so much.
1366	0	"Because, when I went to the very end of the 2008 campaign with then Senator Obama..."
1367	0	"...Secretary Clinton, you're out of time..."
1368	0	"... We did unify the party, and we did elect a Democratic president..."
1369	0	"...Senator Sanders, on that note...."
1370	0	"... Let me, if I may just briefly say something..."
1371	0	"... Senator Sanders, I want to ask you a question about this, and you can incorporate that into your response."
1372	0	Three months now between now and the Democratic convention.
1373	0	Your campaign manager says that you will absolutely take the fight to the floor if neither you nor Secretary Clinton clinches the nomination with pledged delegates alone.
1374	0	(APPLAUSE)
1375	0	Do you vow to take this fight to Philadelphia no matter what?
1376	0	I think we're going to win this nomination to tell you the truth.
1377	0	(CHEERING)
1378	0	"Look, let me acknowledge what is absolutely true."
1379	1	Secretary Clinton cleaned our clock in the Deep South.
1380	0	No question about it.
1381	0	We got murdered there.
1382	0	That is the most conservative part of this great country.
1383	0	That's the fact.
1384	0	But you know what?
1385	0	We're out of the Deep South now.
1386	0	And we're moving up.
1387	0	We got here.
1388	0	We're going to California.
1389	0	We got a number of large states there.
1390	0	"And having won seven out of the last eight caucuses and primaries, having a level of excitement and energy among working people and low-income people doing better against Donald Trump and the other Republicans in poll after poll than Secretary Clinton is, yeah, I believe that we're going to win this nomination, and I believe we're going to obliterate Donald Trump or whoever the Republican candidate is."
1391	0	(APPLAUSE)
1392	0	"Now, let me say this..."
1393	0	"Secretary Clinton, go ahead."
1394	0	I think it's -- I think it's important for people out there watching this tonight to know that I also have a considerable lead in pledged delegates.
1395	0	And my lead in pledged delegates is actually wider than Barack Obama's lead was over me.
1396	0	"And in addition to winning states in the Deep South, we won Florida, Texas, Arizona, Massachusetts, Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina, Missouri."
1397	0	(APPLAUSE)
1398	0	"And so I think where we stand today is that we are in this campaign very confident and optimistic, but it all comes down to reaching every single voter."
1399	0	I'm not taking anything for granted or any voter or any place.
1400	0	So I'm going to work my heart out here in New York until the polls close on Tuesday.
1401	0	"I'm going to work in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware and Maryland, all the way through California."
1402	0	"And when we end up with the number of delegates we need, we will unite the party and have a unified convention..."
1403	0	"Senator, go ahead."
1404	0	... that we'll go onto the general election with.
1405	0	The reason -- the reason why in virtually every contest we are winning by very strong margins younger people -- and I'm not just talking about very young.
1406	0	"You know, the older you get, the younger young gets -- 45 or younger -- is I think people are sensing that establishment politics and dependence on Wall Street and big money interest is really never going to address the crises that we face."
1407	0	(APPLAUSE)
1408	0	"And people understand, you can't take money from powerful special interests into your PAC and then really expect the American people to believe you're going to stand up to these powerful special interests."
1409	0	So I am very proud of the fact that we have brought millions of new people into the political process...
1410	0	"Thank you, Senator."
1411	0	... many of whom previously had given up.
1412	0	"Thank you, Senator, very much."
1413	0	"The candidates, they will make their final pitches to New York voters right after this."
1414	0	Welcome back to the CNN presidential debate.
1415	0	It's time for the candidates' closing statements.
1416	0	Each candidate will have two minutes.
1417	0	"Senator Sanders, you're first."
1418	0	"I grew up in Brooklyn, New York..."
1419	0	(APPLAUSE)
1420	0	"... the son of an immigrant who came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, never made a whole lot of money, but was a very proud American, because this country gave him and my mom the opportunity to send their kids to college."
1421	0	I believe that this country has enormous potential if we have the guts to take on the big money interests who dominate our economic and political life.
1422	0	"And I disagree with Secretary Clinton in the belief that you can get money from Wall Street, that you can get money for a super PAC from powerful special interests, and then at the end of the day do what has to be done for the working families of this country."
1423	0	I just don't accept that.
1424	0	"What I believe is that this country, if we stand together and not let the Trumps of the world divide us up, can guarantee health care to all people as a right, can have paid family and medical leave, can make public colleges and universities tuition-free, can lead the world in transforming our energy system and combatting climate change, can break up the large financial institutions, can demand that the wealthiest people in this country start paying their fair share of taxes."
1425	0	"And we can do that when millions of people stand up, fight back, and create a government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent."
1426	0	(APPLAUSE)
1427	0	That is what the political revolution is about.
1428	0	That is what this campaign is about.
1429	0	"And with your help, we're going to win here in New York."
1430	0	Thank you.
1431	0	Thank you.
1432	0	(APPLAUSE)
1433	0	Secretary Clinton?
1434	0	Secretary Clinton?
1435	0	Thank you.
1436	0	I am very grateful for the fact that the people of New York gave me the great honor of serving as your senator.
1437	0	"You took a chance on me in 2000, and then you re-elected me with one of the biggest margins we've had in our state in 2006."
1438	0	"During those years, we worked closely together."
1439	0	"I tried to have your back, and time and time again, you had mine."
1440	0	We took on the challenges of 9/11 together.
1441	0	We got the money to rebuild New York.
1442	0	"We came to the aid of our brave first responders, construction workers, and others who endangered their own health by helping to save lives and search for survivors."
1443	0	(APPLAUSE)
1444	0	We worked to create jobs -- despite the disastrous policies of George W. Bush -- across New York.
1445	0	And we stood up time and time again against all kinds of vested powerful interests.
1446	0	"I'm asking for your support again in the primary on Tuesday to continue that work together, to take what we did in New York and to take those New York values to the White House, and put them to work on behalf of all of our people, to knock down the barriers that stand in the way."
1447	0	"You know, of course we have economic barriers."
1448	0	I've been fighting against those trying to even the odds most of my adult life.
1449	0	"But we also have racial barriers, gender barriers, homophobic barriers, disability barriers."
1450	0	(APPLAUSE)
1451	0	We have a lot of barriers that stand in the way of people being treated as they should and having the chance to live up to their own God-given potential.
1452	0	So I am humbly asking for your support on Tuesday.
1453	0	I'll work my heart out for you again.
1454	0	"And together, we won't just make promises we can't keep."
1455	0	We'll deliver results that will improve the lives of the people in New York and in America.
1456	0	(APPLAUSE)
1457	0	That's what we'll do together.
1458	0	"Thank you, New York."
1459	0	(APPLAUSE)
1460	0	"Thank you, Secretary."
1461	0	"Thank you very much, Senator."
1462	0	I want to thank the candidates for a really terrific debate.
1463	0	"Thanks also to Dana Bash and Errol Louis, as well as NY1, the Democratic National Committee, and everyone here at the Duggal Greenhouse at the Brooklyn Navy Yard."
1464	0	Stay with CNN now for complete coverage of the New York primary next Tuesday.
1	0	"Thank you, thank you."
2	0	Thank you very much.
3	0	"Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States."
4	0	"USA, USA, USA, USA, USA."
5	0	Who would have believed that when we started this journey because we are a team would have received almost 14 million votes the most in the history of the Republican party and that the Republican party would get 60 percent more votes than it received eight years ago.
6	0	Who would have believed this.
7	0	Who would have believed this.
8	0	The Democrats on the other hand received 20 percent fewer votes than they got four years ago.
9	0	Not so good.
10	0	Not so good.
11	0	"Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace."
12	0	We will be a country of generosity and warmth.
13	0	But we will also be a country of law and order.
14	0	Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation.
15	0	"The attacks on our police, and the terrorism of our cities, threaten our very way of life."
16	0	Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.
17	0	Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities.
18	0	"Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims."
19	0	"I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon, and I mean very soon, come to an end."
20	0	"Beginning on January 20th of 2017, safety will be restored."
21	0	The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens.
22	0	Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.
23	0	It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.
24	0	I will present the facts plainly and honestly.
25	0	We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.
26	0	"So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week."
27	0	Go there.
28	0	"But here, at our convention, there will be no lies."
29	0	"We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else."
30	1	These are the facts: Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration's rollback of criminal enforcement.
31	1	Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's fifty largest cities.
32	1	That's the largest increase in 25 years.
33	1	"In our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent."
34	1	They are up nearly 60% in nearby Baltimore.
35	0	"In the President's hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 people have been the victims of shootings this year alone."
36	0	"And more than 4,000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office."
37	0	The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50% compared to this point last year.
38	0	"Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens."
39	0	The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015.
40	0	They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.
41	0	One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska.
42	0	"There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root."
43	0	"She was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average."
44	0	Number one in her class.
45	0	"Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law."
46	0	I've met Sarah's beautiful family.
47	0	"But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting."
48	0	No more.
49	0	One more child to sacrifice on the order and on the altar of open borders.
50	0	What about our economy?
51	0	"Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African-American youth are now not employed."
52	0	2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago.
53	0	Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.
54	1	"Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000."
55	0	That's sixteen years ago.
56	1	"Our trade deficit has reached an all-time high think of this, think of this, our trade deficit is nearly $800 billion, think of that, 800 billion dollars, last year alone."
57	0	We're going to fix that.
58	0	The budget is no better.
59	0	"President Obama has almost doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing."
60	0	"And yet, what do we have to show for it?"
61	0	"Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps."
62	0	Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad.
63	0	"Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they've lived through one international humiliation after another."
64	0	One after another.
65	0	We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint.
66	1	"This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absolutely nothing – it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated."
67	0	Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria – and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing.
68	0	"In Libya, our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames."
69	0	America is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy.
70	0	"Let's defeat her in November, okay?"
71	0	I am certain that it was a decision that President Obama truly regrets.
72	0	Her bad instincts and her bad judgment – something pointed out by Bernie Sanders – are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today.
73	0	Let's review the record.
74	0	"In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map."
75	0	Libya was stable.
76	0	Egypt was peaceful.
77	0	Iraq was seeing and really a big big reduction in violence.
78	0	Iran was being choked by sanctions.
79	0	Syria was somewhat under control.
80	0	"After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have?"
81	0	"ISIS has spread across the region, and the entire world."
82	0	"Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers."
83	1	"Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control."
84	0	Iraq is in chaos.
85	1	Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons.
86	0	"Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis, now threatens the West."
87	0	"After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before."
88	0	"This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness."
89	0	But Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy.
90	0	"The problems we face now – poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad – will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place."
91	0	A change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes.
92	0	"Tonight, I will share with you my plan for action for America."
93	0	"The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First."
94	0	"Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo."
95	0	"As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect."
96	0	The respect that we deserve.
97	0	The American People will come first once again.
98	0	"My plan will begin with safety at home – which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism."
99	0	There can be no prosperity without law and order.
100	0	"On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America."
101	0	A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation's most powerful special interests.
102	0	That's because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit.
103	0	Believe me.
104	0	It's for their benefit.
105	0	"Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place."
106	0	They are throwing money at her because they have total control over everything single thing she does.
107	0	"She is their puppet, and they pull the strings."
108	0	That is why Hillary Clinton's message is that things will never change.
109	0	Never ever.
110	0	My message is that things have to change – and they have to change right now.
111	0	"Every day I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned."
112	0	"I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals."
113	0	These are the forgotten men and women of our country.
114	0	And they are forgotten.
115	0	But they're not going to be forgotten long.
116	0	These are people who work hard but no longer have a voice.
117	0	I am your voice.
118	0	I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good.
119	0	I have no patience for injustice.
120	0	How great are our police!
121	0	And how great is Cleveland?
122	0	Thank you.
123	0	I have no patience for injustice.
124	0	"No tolerance for government incompetence of which there is so much, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens."
125	0	"When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws – or still worse, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash – I am not able to look the other way."
126	0	And I won't look the other way.
127	1	"And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence – I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our country."
128	0	"When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was ""extremely careless"" and ""negligent,"" in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did."
129	0	"They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible, terrible crimes."
130	0	"In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others who have done far less, have paid so dearly."
131	0	When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come.
132	0	I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people who cannot defend themselves.
133	0	Nobody knows the system better than me.
134	0	Which is why I alone can fix it.
135	0	"I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders – he never had a chance."
136	0	Never had a chance.
137	0	"But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest single issue: trade deals that strip our country of its jobs and strip us of our wealth as a country."
138	0	"Millions of Democrats will join our movement, because we are going to fix the system so it works fairly and justly for all Americans."
139	0	"In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana."
140	0	And a great guy.
141	0	We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana.
142	0	Which is amazing.
143	0	He's a man of character and accomplishment.
144	0	He's the man for the job.
145	0	The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens our community.
146	0	America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed.
147	0	"Immediately after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials."
148	0	"Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee."
149	0	"On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana."
150	0	"Three were killed, and three were very, very badly injured."
151	0	An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans.
152	0	"I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country."
153	0	Believe me.
154	0	Believe me.
155	0	"I will work with, and appoint, the best and brightest prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job properly done."
156	0	"In this race for the White House, I am the Law And Order candidate."
157	0	"The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment that frankly that I have ever seen of anybody in this room has ever watched or seen."
158	0	This Administration has failed America's inner cities.
159	0	"Remember, it has failed America's inner cities."
160	0	It's failed them on education.
161	0	It's failed them on jobs.
162	0	It's failed them on crime.
163	0	It's failed them in every way and at every single level.
164	0	"When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally."
165	0	"Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make better for young Americans in Baltimore, in Chicago, in Detroit, in Ferguson who have really, in every way folks, the same right to live out their dreams as any other child in America?"
166	0	Any other child.
167	0	"To make life safe for all of our citizens, we must also address the growing threats from outside the country."
168	0	We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS and we're going to defeat them fast.
169	0	"Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism."
170	0	"Men, women and children viciously mowed down."
171	0	Lives ruined.
172	0	Families ripped apart.
173	0	A nation in mourning.
174	0	"The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over – at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, at a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee."
175	0	And many many other locations.
176	0	"Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist."
177	0	"This time, the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community."
178	0	"No good, and we're going to stop it."
179	0	"As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology."
180	0	Believe me.
181	0	And I have to say as a Republican it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said.
182	0	Thank you.
183	0	"To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things."
184	0	"We must have the best, absolutely the best gathering of intelligence anywhere in the world."
185	0	The best.
186	0	"We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, in Libya, in Egypt and in Syria."
187	0	"Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly."
188	0	We're going to win.
189	0	We're going to win fast.
190	0	"This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel."
191	0	"Recently, I have said NATO is obsolete because it did not properly cover terror."
192	0	And also that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share.
193	0	"As usual, the United States has been picking up the costs."
194	0	"Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism."
195	0	A true step in the right direction.
196	0	"Lastly, and very importantly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place."
197	0	We don't want them in our country.
198	1	"My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian, think of this."
199	0	"Think of this, this is not believable but this is what's happening."
200	1	A 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country already under the leadership of President Obama.
201	1	She proposes this despite the fact that there's no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from.
202	0	I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people.
203	0	"Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never ever will be."
204	0	"Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers."
205	0	"We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people."
206	0	"On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants: Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and my friend Jamiel Shaw."
207	0	They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so greatly.
208	0	"Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more, nothing even close I have to tell you, than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our borders which we can solve."
209	0	We have to solve it.
210	0	These families have no special interests to represent them.
211	0	There are no demonstrators to protect them and certainly none to protest on their behalf.
212	0	"My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain."
213	0	Believe me.
214	0	"Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities."
215	0	But where was the sanctuary for Kate Steinle?
216	0	"Where was the Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, and Sabine and Jamiel?"
217	0	"Where was sanctuary for all the other, it's so sad to even be talking about it, because we can solve this problem so quickly."
218	0	"Where was the sanctuary for all of the Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly?"
219	0	These wounded American families have been alone.
220	0	But they are not alone any longer.
221	0	"Tonight, this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering and the same awful fate."
222	0	"<br>We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities."
223	0	I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America's Border Patrol Agents.
224	0	"And will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful, lawful, lawful immigration system."
225	0	Lawful.
226	0	"By ending catch-and-release on the border, we will end the cycle of human smuggling and violence."
227	0	Illegal border crossings will go down.
228	0	"We will stop it, it won't be happening very much anymore."
229	0	Believe me.
230	0	Peace will be restored.
231	0	"By enforcing the rules for millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect that they deserve."
232	0	"Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied – and every politician who has denied them – to listen very, very closely to the words I am about to say."
233	0	"On January 20th of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced."
234	0	We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone.
235	0	But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.
236	0	USA.
237	0	USA.
238	0	USA.
239	0	My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton.
240	0	Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration.
241	0	Which is what we have now.
242	0	Communities want relief.
243	0	"Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness."
244	0	"Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape the tremendous cycle poverty that they're going through right now and make it almost impossible for them to join the middle class."
245	0	I have a different vision for our workers.
246	0	"It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat."
247	0	Of which there are many.
248	0	"It's been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office."
249	0	I have made billions of dollars in business making deals – now I'm going to make our country rich again.
250	0	"Using the greatest business people in the world, which our country has, I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements."
251	0	"America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton."
252	1	"Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country."
253	0	"Or frankly, any other country."
254	0	Never ever again.
255	0	"I am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania, and New York, and Michigan, and all of America – and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequence."
256	0	Not going to happen anymore.
257	0	"My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class."
258	0	"She supported NAFTA, and she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization – another one of her husband's colossal mistakes and disasters."
259	0	She supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea.
260	0	She supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
261	0	"Which will not only destroy our manufacturers, but will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments."
262	0	And it's not going to happen.
263	0	I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers or that diminishes our freedom or independence.
264	0	We will never sign bad trade deals.
265	0	America First again.
266	0	America First.
267	0	"Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries."
268	0	"No longer will we enter into these massive transactions, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long – and which no one from our country even reads or understands."
269	0	"We are going to enforce all trade violations, against any country that cheats."
270	0	"This includes stopping China's outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation."
271	0	They are the greatest that ever came about.
272	0	They are the greatest currency manipulators ever.
273	0	Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others will be totally renegotiated.
274	0	That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America – and we'll walk away if we don't get that kind of a deal.
275	0	Our country is going to start building and making things again.
276	0	"Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules."
277	1	"While Hillary Clinton plans a massive, and I mean massive, tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for the president this year – Democrat or Republican."
278	1	"While Hillary Clinton plans a massive, and I mean massive, tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for the president this year – Democrat or Republican."
279	1	"Middle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone."
280	0	I mean everyone.
281	1	America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world.
282	0	Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country.
283	0	"Believe me, it'll happen and it'll happen fast."
284	0	"Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all."
285	1	"Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it very, very quickly."
286	0	We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy.
287	0	This will produce more than $20 trillion in job-creating economic activity over the next four decades.
288	0	"My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and the great steelworkers of our country out of work and out of business – that will never happen with Donald J Trump as president."
289	0	Our steelworkers and our miners are going back to work again.
290	0	"With these new economic policies, trillions and trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country."
291	0	"This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans – We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow."
292	0	"This, in turn, will create millions of more jobs."
293	0	We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.
294	0	My opponent would rather protect bureaucrats than serve American children.
295	0	And that's what she's doing.
296	0	And that's what's she's done.
297	0	We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.
298	1	You will be able to choose your own doctor again.
299	0	And we will fix TSA at the airports!
300	0	Which is a total disaster.
301	0	We're going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out in their adult lives.
302	0	Tremendous problem.
303	0	"We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive cost to us, will be asked to pay their fair share."
304	0	We will take care of our great Veterans like they have never been taken care of before.
305	0	My just released 10 point plan has received tremendous veteran support.
306	0	We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice without waiting five days on a line and dying.
307	0	My opponent dismissed the VA scandal.
308	0	One more sign of how out of touch she really is.
309	0	We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days.
310	0	"The politicians have talked about this for years, but I'm going to do it."
311	0	We are going to appoint justices of the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.
312	0	The replacement of our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and principles and judicial philosophies.
313	0	Very important.
314	0	This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election.
315	0	My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment.
316	0	"I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe."
317	0	"At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical and religious community because I'll tell you what."
318	0	"Because the support they've given me, and I'm not sure I totally deserve it, has been so amazing."
319	0	And has had such a big reason for me being here tonight.
320	0	True.
321	0	So true.
322	0	"They have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits."
323	0	"An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views."
324	0	Their voice has been taken away.
325	0	I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and to protect free speech for all Americans.
326	0	"We can accomplish these great things, and so much more – all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again."
327	0	Start believing.
328	0	"It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better and stronger than ever before."
329	0	"In this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy."
330	0	"And by the way, Melania and Ivanka, did they do a job."
331	0	"My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew."
332	0	"I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this, and to see me, tonight."
333	0	"It's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people."
334	0	"He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, and carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also."
335	0	I love those people.
336	0	"Then there's my mother, Mary."
337	0	"She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded."
338	0	She was a truly great mother.
339	0	"She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great great judge of character."
340	0	She could pick 'em out from anywhere.
341	0	"To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me."
342	0	I have had a truly great life in business.
343	0	"But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country – to go to work for you."
344	0	It's time to deliver a victory for the American people.
345	0	"We don't win anymore, but we are going to start winning again."
346	0	"But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past."
347	0	"America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics."
348	0	"Remember: all of the people telling you you can't have the country you want, are the same people telling you that wouldn't stand, I mean they said Trump doesn't have a chance of being here tonight."
349	0	Not a chance.
350	0	The same people.
351	0	Oh we love defeating those people.
352	0	Don't we?
353	0	Don't we?
354	0	Love it.
355	0	Love it.
356	0	Love it.
357	0	"No longer can we rely on those same people in the media media, and politics, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place."
358	0	"Instead, we must choose to Believe In America."
359	0	History is watching us now.
360	0	"We don't have much time, but history is watching."
361	0	"It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong."
362	0	I am asking for your support tonight so I can be your champion in the White House.
363	0	And I will be your champion.
364	0	My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge.
365	0	"It reads: ""I'm With Her""."
366	0	I choose to recite a different pledge.
367	0	"My pledge reads: ""I'M WITH YOU – THE AMERICAN PEOPLE."""
368	0	I am your voice.
369	0	"So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I am With You, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you."
370	0	"To all Americans tonight, in all of our cities and in all of our towns, I make this promise: We Will Make America Strong Again."
371	0	We Will Make America Proud Again.
372	0	We Will Make America Safe Again.
373	0	And We Will Make America Great Again.
374	0	"God bless you, and goodnight."
375	0	I love you.
1	0	"Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York."
2	0	"I'm Lester Holt, anchor of ""NBC Nightly News."""
3	0	I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate.
4	0	The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
5	0	"This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization."
6	0	"The commission drafted tonight's format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns."
7	0	"The 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long."
8	0	We'll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America's direction; and securing America.
9	0	"At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond."
10	0	"From that point until the end of the segment, we'll have an open discussion."
11	0	The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns.
12	0	The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.
13	0	"I will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump."
14	0	(APPLAUSE)
15	0	"How are you, Donald?"
16	0	(APPLAUSE)
17	0	Good luck to you.
18	0	(APPLAUSE)
19	0	"Well, I don't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled."
20	0	"We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we're going to press for specifics."
21	0	"I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people."
22	0	"Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values."
23	0	"So, let's begin."
24	0	"We're calling this opening segment ""Achieving Prosperity."""
25	0	And central to that is jobs.
26	0	There are two economic realities in America today.
27	0	"There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation."
28	0	"However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck."
29	0	"Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?"
30	0	"Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us."
31	0	The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.
32	0	"Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot."
33	0	"First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top."
34	0	"That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes."
35	0	I want us to invest in you.
36	0	I want us to invest in your future.
37	0	"That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business."
38	0	We also have to make the economy fairer.
39	0	"That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work."
40	0	I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing.
41	0	"If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top."
42	0	And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work.
43	0	I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under.
44	0	"So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days."
45	0	Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.
46	0	How are we going to do it?
47	0	We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.
48	0	"Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you."
49	0	We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country.
50	0	"You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better."
51	0	I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.
52	0	"Secretary Clinton, thank you."
53	0	"Mr. Trump, the same question to you."
54	0	It's about putting money -- more money into the pockets of American workers.
55	0	You have up to two minutes.
56	0	"Thank you, Lester."
57	0	Our jobs are fleeing the country.
58	0	They're going to Mexico.
59	0	They're going to many other countries.
60	0	You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product.
61	0	"They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them."
62	0	And we have a very good fight.
63	0	And we have a winning fight.
64	0	"Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing."
65	0	"So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them."
66	0	"When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world."
67	0	"They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants."
68	0	"With the United States, as he said, not so much."
69	1	So Ford is leaving.
70	1	"You see that, their small car division leaving."
71	1	"Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio."
72	0	They're all leaving.
73	0	And we can't allow it to happen anymore.
74	0	"As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that."
75	0	"We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later."
76	0	But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.
77	0	"We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people."
78	0	All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis.
79	0	"They left -- fired 1,400 people."
80	0	They're going to Mexico.
81	0	So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.
82	0	We cannot let it happen.
83	0	"Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses."
84	0	That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.
85	0	It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.
86	0	Companies will come.
87	0	They will build.
88	0	They will expand.
89	0	New companies will start.
90	0	"And I look very, very much forward to doing it."
91	0	"We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs."
92	0	"Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?"
93	0	"Well, I think that trade is an important issue."
94	0	"Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent."
95	0	"And we need to have smart, fair trade deals."
96	0	"We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions."
97	0	And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again.
98	0	"In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had."
99	0	"I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be."
100	0	That is not how we grow the economy.
101	0	"We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes."
102	0	I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.
103	0	I understand that.
104	0	"You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit."
105	1	"He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there."
106	0	I don't buy that.
107	0	I have a different experience.
108	0	My father was a small-businessman.
109	0	He worked really hard.
110	0	"He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going."
111	0	"And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow."
112	0	That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.
113	0	"Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can."
114	0	"You've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans."
115	0	How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas?
116	0	"How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?"
117	1	"Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs."
118	0	Our country's in deep trouble.
119	0	"We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China."
120	0	"They're the best, the best ever at it."
121	0	"What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing."
122	0	So we have to do that.
123	0	We have to renegotiate our trade deals.
124	0	"And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do."
125	0	Let me give you the example of Mexico.
126	0	They have a VAT tax.
127	0	We're on a different system.
128	0	"When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax."
129	0	"When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately."
130	0	"When they sell into us, there's no tax."
131	0	It's a defective agreement.
132	0	"It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it."
133	0	"Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK?"
134	0	Good.
135	0	I want you to be very happy.
136	0	It's very important to me.
137	0	"But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently."
138	0	She's been doing this for 30 years.
139	0	And why hasn't she made the agreements better?
140	0	The NAFTA agreement is defective.
141	0	"Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact..."
142	0	"Let me interrupt just a moment, but..."
143	0	"Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement."
144	0	They should have been doing this for years.
145	0	"What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion."
146	0	"We cannot do it any longer, Lester."
147	0	"Back to the question, though."
148	0	"How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers?"
149	0	How do you make them bring the jobs back?
150	0	"Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave."
151	0	The companies are leaving.
152	0	"I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them."
153	0	"They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever."
154	0	"And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck."
155	0	We wish you a lot of luck.
156	0	"But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong."
157	0	"And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies."
158	0	"So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving."
159	0	We have to stop them from leaving.
160	0	"And that's a big, big factor."
161	0	Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.
162	0	"Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago."
163	0	"We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s."
164	0	"That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm."
165	0	"In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis."
166	0	"He said, back in 2006, ""Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money."""
167	0	"Well, it did collapse."
168	0	"That's called business, by the way."
169	0	Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs.
170	0	Five million people lost their homes.
171	0	And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.
172	0	"Now, we have come back from that abyss."
173	0	And it has not been easy.
174	0	"So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place."
175	1	"Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession."
176	1	"They've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy."
177	0	Take clean energy.
178	0	Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century.
179	1	Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.
180	0	I think it's real.
181	0	I did not.
182	0	I did not.
183	0	I do not say that.
184	0	I think science is real.
185	0	I do not say that.
186	0	"And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad."
187	0	And here's what we can do.
188	0	We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels.
189	0	We can have enough clean energy to power every home.
190	0	We can build a new modern electric grid.
191	0	That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.
192	0	"So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place."
193	0	Mr. Trump?
194	0	She talks about solar panels.
195	0	"We invested in a solar company, our country."
196	0	That was a disaster.
197	0	They lost plenty of money on that one.
198	0	"Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work."
199	0	Our energy policies are a disaster.
200	0	"Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt."
201	0	You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.
202	0	"The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it."
203	0	"He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact."
204	0	So I will tell you this.
205	0	We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs.
206	0	"And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it."
207	0	"And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone."
208	0	"And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this."
209	0	You've been doing this for 30 years.
210	0	Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?
211	0	"For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions."
212	0	"Well, actually..."
213	0	I will bring -- excuse me.
214	0	I will bring back jobs.
215	0	You can't bring back jobs.
216	0	"Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit."
217	0	"Yeah, for 30 years."
218	0	"And I have -- well, not quite that long."
219	0	I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s.
220	0	I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...
221	1	"Well, he approved NAFTA..."
222	0	(CROSSTALK)
223	0	"million new jobs, a balanced budget..."
224	1	"He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country."
225	0	Incomes went up for everybody.
226	0	"Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts."
227	0	"When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test."
228	0	Will they create jobs in America?
229	0	Will they raise incomes in America?
230	0	And are they good for our national security?
231	0	Some of them I voted for.
232	0	"The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against."
233	0	And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.
234	0	But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy.
235	0	"I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do."
236	0	I'm going to have a special prosecutor.
237	0	"We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable."
238	0	"When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent."
239	0	We increased them to China 50 percent.
240	0	So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.
241	0	Very quickly...
242	0	But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...
243	0	"Well, I've been a senator, Donald..."
244	0	You haven't done it.
245	0	You haven't done it.
246	0	And I have been a secretary of state...
247	0	Excuse me.
248	0	And I have done a lot...
249	1	"Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry."
250	0	"Well, that's your opinion."
251	0	That is your opinion.
252	0	"You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent."
253	0	"NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country."
254	0	And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership.
255	0	You were totally in favor of it.
256	0	"Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate."
257	0	"But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA."
258	0	Nothing will ever top NAFTA.
259	0	"Well, that is just not accurate."
260	0	I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.
261	0	I wrote about that in...
262	1	You called it the gold standard.
263	0	(CROSSTALK)
264	1	You called it the gold standard of trade deals.
265	1	You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.
266	0	No.
267	0	"And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it."
268	0	"Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts."
269	0	"The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated..."
270	0	Not.
271	0	"which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't."
272	0	I wrote about that in my book...
273	0	So is it President Obama's fault?
274	0	before you even announced.
275	0	Is it President Obama's fault?
276	0	"Look, there are differences..."
277	0	"Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?"
278	0	There are...
279	0	Because he's pushing it.
280	0	"There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world."
281	0	And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again.
282	0	"That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt."
283	0	But you have no plan.
284	0	"But in -- oh, but I do."
285	0	"Secretary, you have no plan."
286	0	"In fact, I have written a book about it."
287	0	"It's called ""Stronger Together."""
288	0	You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...
289	0	That's about all you've...
290	0	(CROSSTALK)
291	0	"Folks, we're going to..."
292	0	or at an airport near you.
293	0	We're going to move to...
294	0	"But it's because I see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth."
295	0	We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.
296	0	So we have a very robust set of plans.
297	0	"And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession."
298	0	You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history.
299	0	You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history.
300	0	You are going to drive business out.
301	0	"Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place."
302	0	"And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan."
303	0	I'm very proud of it.
304	0	It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.
305	0	"But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence."
306	0	"When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over."
307	0	"And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation."
308	0	"You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business."
309	0	And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.
310	0	I'm going to cut regulations.
311	0	"I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story."
312	0	"Let me get you to pause right there, because we're going to move into -- we're going to move into the next segment."
313	0	We're going to talk taxes...
314	0	That can't -- that can't be left to stand.
315	0	Please just take 30 seconds and then we're going to go on.
316	0	"I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so..."
317	0	Facts.
318	0	"So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker."
319	0	"So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look."
320	0	Because what I have proposed...
321	0	"And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see."
322	0	"would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt."
323	0	What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses.
324	0	"What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy."
325	0	And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.
326	0	"Well, you just opened the next segment."
327	0	"Well, could I just finish -- I think I..."
328	0	(CROSSTALK)
329	0	I'm going to give you a chance right here...
330	0	"I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website."
331	0	with a new 15-minute segment...
332	0	She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.
333	0	"Mr. Trump, I'm going to..."
334	0	And look at her website.
335	0	You know what?
336	0	It's no difference than this.
337	0	She's telling us how to fight ISIS.
338	0	Just go to her website.
339	0	She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website.
340	0	I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.
341	0	"The next segment, we're continuing..."
342	0	"Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS."
343	0	achieving prosperity...
344	0	"No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do."
345	0	"No, we're not."
346	0	"No, we're not."
347	0	"See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do."
348	0	No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.
349	0	"That's a -- that's -- go to the -- please, fact checkers, get to work."
350	0	"OK, you are unpacking a lot here."
351	0	And we're still on the issue of achieving prosperity.
352	0	And I want to talk about taxes.
353	0	The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy.
354	0	"Secretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans."
355	0	I'd like you to further defend that.
356	0	"And, Mr. Trump, you're calling for tax cuts for the wealthy."
357	0	I'd like you to defend that.
358	0	"And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump."
359	0	"Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs."
360	0	They're going to expand their companies.
361	0	They're going to do a tremendous job.
362	0	I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision.
363	0	"And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy."
364	0	It's a great thing for the middle class.
365	0	It's a great thing for companies to expand.
366	0	"And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad."
367	0	"So what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country."
368	0	"And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back."
369	0	"Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together."
370	0	Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.
371	0	And here's the thing.
372	0	"Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion."
373	0	I happen to think it's double that.
374	0	"It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester."
375	0	"And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful."
376	0	But we have no leadership.
377	0	"And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton."
378	0	All right.
379	0	"You have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton."
380	0	"I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened."
381	0	Why not?
382	0	Why not?
383	0	"Yeah, why not?"
384	0	(LAUGHTER)
385	0	"You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things."
386	0	"Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case..."
387	0	There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.
388	0	"This is -- this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes, please."
389	0	Yes.
390	0	"Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester."
391	0	We've looked at your tax proposals.
392	0	"I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas."
393	0	I happen to support that.
394	0	Then you didn't read it.
395	0	I happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit.
396	0	"But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do."
397	0	You've proposed an approach that has a...
398	0	Who gave it that name?
399	0	The first I've -- who gave it that name?
400	0	(CROSSTALK)
401	0	"Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes."
402	0	$4 billion tax benefit for your family.
403	0	And when you look at what you are proposing...
404	0	How much?
405	0	How much for my family?
406	0	it is...
407	0	"Lester, how much?"
408	0	"as I said, trumped-up trickle-down."
409	0	Trickle-down did not work.
410	0	"It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009."
411	0	Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.
412	0	"And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that."
413	0	"And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class."
414	0	I don't think top-down works in America.
415	0	"I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate."
416	0	Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy.
417	0	"Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top."
418	0	"Mr. Trump, we're..."
419	0	Typical politician.
420	0	"All talk, no action."
421	0	"Sounds good, doesn't work."
422	0	Never going to happen.
423	0	Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.
424	0	"Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression."
425	0	And believe me: We're in a bubble right now.
426	0	"And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down."
427	0	"We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble."
428	0	And we better be awfully careful.
429	0	And we have a Fed that's doing political things.
430	0	This Janet Yellen of the Fed.
431	0	The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level.
432	0	"And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job."
433	0	The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.
434	0	"Mr. Trump, we're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns."
435	0	And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to -- who he owes it to and any business conflicts.
436	0	Don't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?
437	0	I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit.
438	0	And it'll be released.
439	0	"And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released."
440	0	"But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have."
441	0	"It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million."
442	0	"If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised."
443	0	But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.
444	1	"When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year."
445	0	You know what that is?
446	0	"That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?"
447	0	We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.
448	0	The IRS says an audit...
449	0	Excuse me.
450	0	of your taxes -- you're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit.
451	0	"And so the question, does the public's right to know outweigh your personal..."
452	0	"Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit."
453	0	"Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years."
454	0	I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited.
455	0	"I said, do you get audited?"
456	0	I get audited almost every year.
457	0	"And in a way, I should be complaining."
458	0	I'm not even complaining.
459	0	I don't mind it.
460	0	It's almost become a way of life.
461	0	I get audited by the IRS.
462	0	But other people don't.
463	0	I will say this.
464	0	We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of.
465	0	"I will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted."
466	0	"As soon as she releases them, I will release."
467	0	(APPLAUSE)
468	0	I will release my tax returns.
469	0	"And that's against -- my lawyers, they say, ""Don't do it."""
470	0	I will tell you this.
471	0	"No -- in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers."
472	0	"Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete."
473	0	"When the audit's complete, I'll do it."
474	0	But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.
475	0	So it's negotiable?
476	0	"It's not negotiable, no."
477	0	Let her release the e-mails.
478	0	"Why did she delete 33,000..."
479	0	"Well, I'll let her answer that."
480	0	But let me just admonish the audience one more time.
481	0	There was an agreement.
482	0	"We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us."
483	0	Secretary Clinton?
484	0	"Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here."
485	0	"For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns."
486	0	"You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it."
487	0	We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.
488	0	"So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?"
489	0	And I think there may be a couple of reasons.
490	0	"First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is."
491	0	"Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be."
492	0	"Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks."
493	1	"Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax."
494	0	That makes me smart.
495	0	"So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health."
496	0	"And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide."
497	0	"And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate."
498	0	They don't give you all the details that tax returns would.
499	0	And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see.
500	0	"And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding."
501	0	And we'll guess.
502	0	We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.
503	0	"But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?"
504	0	Who does he owe money to?
505	0	"Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them."
506	0	He also -- he also raised the issue of your e-mails.
507	0	Do you want to respond to that?
508	0	I do.
509	0	"You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail."
510	0	That's for sure.
511	0	"And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently."
512	0	But I'm not going to make any excuses.
513	0	"It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that."
514	0	Mr. Trump?
515	0	That was more than a mistake.
516	0	That was done purposely.
517	0	OK?
518	0	That was not a mistake.
519	0	That was done purposely.
520	0	"When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful."
521	0	"And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also."
522	1	"As far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns."
523	0	That I can tell you.
524	0	You learn a lot from financial disclosure.
525	0	And you should go down and take a look at that.
526	0	"The other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged."
527	0	"The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money."
528	0	It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.
529	0	"The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion."
530	0	And the $650 isn't even on that.
531	0	But it's not $650.
532	0	It's much less than that.
533	0	"But I could give you a list of banks, I would -- if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks."
534	0	"These are very fine institutions, very fine banks."
535	0	I could do that very quickly.
536	0	I am very underleveraged.
537	0	I have a great company.
538	0	I have a tremendous income.
539	0	And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.
540	0	It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.
541	0	"When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports."
542	0	Our airports are like from a third world country.
543	0	"You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we've become a third world country."
544	0	So the worst of all things has happened.
545	0	"We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess."
546	0	We haven't even started.
547	0	"And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw."
548	0	"Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice."
549	0	And it's really a shame.
550	0	And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem.
551	0	Our country has tremendous problems.
552	0	We're a debtor nation.
553	0	We're a serious debtor nation.
554	0	"And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals."
555	0	"And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas."
556	0	We'll let you respond and we'll move on to the next segment.
557	0	And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years.
558	0	(APPLAUSE)
559	0	And the other thing I think is important...
560	0	"It would be squandered, too, believe me."
561	0	"is if your -- if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that."
562	0	"You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys."
563	0	"And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald."
564	0	"I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do."
565	0	We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses.
566	0	It's a beautiful facility.
567	0	It immediately was put to use.
568	0	"And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do..."
569	0	Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work...
570	0	"Well, to..."
571	0	"Which our country should do, too."
572	0	"Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?"
573	0	I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.
574	0	"He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides."
575	1	"And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times."
576	0	There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once.
577	0	You call yourself the King of Debt.
578	0	You talk about leverage.
579	0	You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.
580	0	Wrong.
581	0	Wrong.
582	0	"Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government."
583	0	Let's let Mr. Trump...
584	0	And we need to be very clear about that.
585	0	"So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time."
586	0	"Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites."
587	0	I built an unbelievable company.
588	0	"Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places."
589	0	It's an unbelievable company.
590	1	"But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there."
591	0	"And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation."
592	0	"Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws."
593	0	But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company.
594	0	"My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies."
595	0	And that's what I do.
596	0	But what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me.
597	0	I'll give you an example.
598	0	"We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another."
599	0	But we're opening the Old Post Office.
600	0	"Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money."
601	0	I'm a year ahead of schedule.
602	0	And that's what this country should be doing.
603	0	We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost.
604	0	"We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing."
605	0	"When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy."
606	0	The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule.
607	0	And we should be able to do that for our country.
608	0	"Well, we're well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment."
609	0	We move into our next segment talking about America's direction.
610	0	And let's start by talking about race.
611	0	"The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we've seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa."
612	0	"Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap."
613	0	So how do you heal the divide?
614	0	"Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this."
615	0	"Well, you're right."
616	0	Race remains a significant challenge in our country.
617	0	"Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system."
618	0	We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.
619	0	And we've got to do several things at the same time.
620	0	We have to restore trust between communities and the police.
621	0	"We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary."
622	0	"Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law."
623	0	"Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods."
624	0	"So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform."
625	0	I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.
626	0	"But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform."
627	0	So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.
628	0	And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.
629	0	"The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together."
630	0	"So we have to do two things, as I said."
631	0	We have to restore trust.
632	0	We have to work with the police.
633	0	We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.
634	0	"And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today."
635	0	"All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes."
636	0	How do you heal the divide?
637	0	"Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order."
638	0	And we need law and order.
639	0	"If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country."
640	0	"And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country."
641	0	"I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in."
642	0	"We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States."
643	0	"We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous."
644	0	"You walk down the street, you get shot."
645	0	"In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st."
646	0	Thousands of shootings.
647	0	"And I'm saying, where is this?"
648	0	Is this a war-torn country?
649	0	What are we doing?
650	0	And we have to stop the violence.
651	0	We have to bring back law and order.
652	1	"In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed."
653	0	We have to bring back law and order.
654	0	"Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York."
655	0	It brought the crime rate way down.
656	0	But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.
657	0	We have gangs roaming the street.
658	0	"And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants."
659	0	And they have guns.
660	0	And they shoot people.
661	0	And we have to be very strong.
662	0	And we have to be very vigilant.
663	0	We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing.
664	0	"Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything."
665	0	"We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated."
666	0	"Your two -- your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up."
667	1	"Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men."
668	0	"No, you're wrong."
669	0	"It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge."
670	0	It was taken away from her.
671	0	"And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case."
672	0	They would have won an appeal.
673	0	"If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed."
674	0	The argument is that it's a form of racial profiling.
675	0	"No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them."
676	0	These are felons.
677	0	"These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk."
678	0	You need more police.
679	0	"You need a better community, you know, relation."
680	0	You don't have good community relations in Chicago.
681	0	It's terrible.
682	0	I have property there.
683	0	It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.
684	0	"But when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places."
685	0	You need better relationships.
686	0	I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.
687	0	"You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good."
688	0	"But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently."
689	0	So there's some bad things going on.
690	0	Some really bad things.
691	0	Secretary Clinton...
692	0	"But we need -- Lester, we need law and order."
693	0	"And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people."
694	0	And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.
695	0	Secretary Clinton?
696	0	"Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country."
697	0	Ugh.
698	0	"You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids."
699	0	There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.
700	0	But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.
701	0	"There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective."
702	1	"Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective."
703	0	It did not do what it needed to do.
704	0	"Now, I believe in community policing."
705	0	"And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991."
706	0	Property crime is down 40 percent.
707	0	We just don't want to see it creep back up.
708	0	We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.
709	0	"But there were some problems, some unintended consequences."
710	0	Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.
711	0	"And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated."
712	0	So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.
713	0	We cannot just say law and order.
714	0	"We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little."
715	0	We need to have more second chance programs.
716	0	I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system.
717	0	You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.
718	0	So there are some positive ways we can work on this.
719	0	And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.
720	0	"Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets."
721	0	"In a lot of places, our police are outgunned."
722	0	"We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm."
723	0	And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country.
724	0	"If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun."
725	0	"So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way."
726	0	"Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias."
727	0	Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?
728	0	"Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police."
729	0	"I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other."
730	0	"And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?"
731	0	"But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers."
732	0	"I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago."
733	0	They admit it's an issue.
734	0	They've got a lot of concerns.
735	0	"Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street."
736	0	"They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance."
737	0	And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.
738	0	Mr. Trump...
739	0	I'd like to respond to that.
740	0	Please.
741	0	"First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists."
742	0	I agree with you.
743	0	"When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of."
744	0	"These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment."
745	0	But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.
746	0	"And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off."
747	0	But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.
748	0	I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth.
749	0	"And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know."
750	0	I think you've apologized for it.
751	0	But I think it was a terrible thing to say.
752	0	"And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away."
753	0	"Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them."
754	0	"And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth."
755	0	"I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders."
756	0	Five hundred murders is a lot of murders.
757	0	"It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?"
758	0	"But we went from 2,200 to 500."
759	0	And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg.
760	0	And it was terminated by current mayor.
761	0	But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.
762	0	Tremendous beyond belief.
763	0	"So when you say it has no impact, it really did."
764	0	"It had a very, very big impact."
765	1	"Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders."
766	0	So there is...
767	0	"No, you're wrong."
768	0	You're wrong.
769	0	"No, I'm not."
770	1	Murders are up.
771	0	All right.
772	0	You check it.
773	0	New York -- New York has done an excellent job.
774	0	"And I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked."
775	0	"And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well."
776	0	"Look, one murder is too many."
777	0	But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.
778	0	And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want.
779	0	Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?
780	0	"But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods."
781	0	"And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem."
782	0	This conversation is about race.
783	0	"And so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five..."
784	0	"I'd like to just respond, if I might."
785	0	Please -- 20 seconds.
786	0	I'd just like to respond.
787	0	"Please respond, then I've got a quick follow-up for you."
788	0	I will.
789	0	"Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians."
790	0	"They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years."
791	0	"The African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated."
792	0	"They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is."
793	0	They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.
794	0	"Mr. Trump, let me..."
795	0	(CROSSTALK)
796	0	"Well, I -- I do think..."
797	0	"And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place."
798	0	"You decided to stay home, and that's OK."
799	0	"But I will tell you, I've been all over."
800	0	And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities.
801	0	"And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done."
802	0	"Mr. Trump, I..."
803	0	I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate.
804	0	"And, yes, I did."
805	0	And you know what else I prepared for?
806	0	I prepared to be president.
807	0	And I think that's a good thing.
808	0	(APPLAUSE)
809	0	"Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation's first black president was not a natural-born citizen."
810	0	You questioned his legitimacy.
811	0	"In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States."
812	0	Can you tell us what took you so long?
813	0	"I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say."
814	0	Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton.
815	0	"And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard."
816	0	"And you can go look it up, and you can check it out."
817	1	"And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened."
818	1	"Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it."
819	0	They were pressing it very hard.
820	0	She failed to get the birth certificate.
821	0	"When I got involved, I didn't fail."
822	0	I got him to give the birth certificate.
823	0	So I'm satisfied with it.
824	0	And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.
825	0	That was...
826	0	(CROSSTALK)
827	0	"Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country."
828	0	I will let you respond.
829	0	It's important.
830	0	But I just want to get the answer here.
831	0	The birth certificate was produced in 2011.
832	0	"You've continued to tell the story and question the president's legitimacy in 2012, '13, '14, '15..."
833	0	Yeah.
834	0	as recently as January.
835	0	"So the question is, what changed your mind?"
836	0	"Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it."
837	0	"I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course."
838	0	But nobody was caring much about it.
839	0	But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate.
840	0	And I think I did a good job.
841	0	Secretary Clinton also fought it.
842	0	"I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true."
843	0	"Look, it's true."
844	1	"Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager."
845	0	And she was involved.
846	0	"But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce."
847	0	I'm sorry.
848	0	"I'm just going to follow up -- and I will let you respond to that, because there's a lot there."
849	0	But we're talking about racial healing in this segment.
850	0	"What do you say to Americans, people of color who..."
851	0	(CROSSTALK)
852	0	"Well, it was very -- I say nothing."
853	0	"I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it."
854	0	He should have produced it a long time before.
855	0	I say nothing.
856	0	But let me just tell you.
857	0	"When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community."
858	0	I think you can see that.
859	0	And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.
860	0	"And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate."
861	0	Secretary Clinton?
862	0	"Well, just listen to what you heard."
863	0	(LAUGHTER)
864	0	"And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed."
865	0	But it can't be dismissed that easily.
866	0	He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen.
867	0	"There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it."
868	0	"But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy."
869	0	He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.
870	0	So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.
871	0	And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.
872	0	"You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity."
873	0	And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.
874	0	"But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high."
875	0	"And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down."
876	0	"Mr. Trump, you can respond and we're going to move on to the next segment."
877	0	I would love to respond.
878	0	"First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama."
879	0	You treated him with terrible disrespect.
880	0	And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.
881	0	It doesn't work that way.
882	0	"You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures."
883	0	I don't think you can deny that.
884	0	"But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true."
885	0	"So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work."
886	0	It really doesn't.
887	0	"Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued."
888	0	We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt.
889	0	It was very easy to do.
890	0	I notice you bring that up a lot.
891	0	"And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you."
892	0	Maybe I'm trying to save the money.
893	0	"But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing?"
894	0	"Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things."
895	0	I'll go one step further.
896	0	"In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it."
897	0	"No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody."
898	0	And it's a tremendously successful club.
899	0	And I'm so glad I did it.
900	0	And I have been given great credit for what I did.
901	0	"And I'm very, very proud of it."
902	0	And that's the way I feel.
903	0	That is the true way I feel.
904	0	"Our next segment is called ""Securing America."""
905	0	We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country.
906	0	"Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen."
907	0	"So my question is, who's behind it?"
908	0	And how do we fight it?
909	0	"Secretary Clinton, this answer goes to you."
910	0	"Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries."
911	0	There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.
912	0	"But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states."
913	0	The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia.
914	0	"There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this."
915	0	"I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really..."
916	0	(CROSSTALK)
917	0	"tough, long game here."
918	0	"And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee."
919	0	"And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information."
920	0	"We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity."
921	0	"And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information."
922	0	And we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have.
923	0	We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare.
924	0	But we will defend the citizens of this country.
925	0	And the Russians need to understand that.
926	0	"I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do."
927	0	And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans.
928	0	That is just unacceptable.
929	0	It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations...
930	0	Your two minutes have expired.
931	0	have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief.
932	0	It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.
933	0	"Mr. Trump, you have two minutes and the same question."
934	0	Who's behind it?
935	0	And how do we fight it?
936	0	"I do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country."
937	0	"That just happened, and many more are coming."
938	0	And I'm very proud of it.
939	0	"In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE."
940	0	They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration.
941	0	I was just endorsed by ICE.
942	0	"I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents."
943	0	"So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge."
944	0	OK?
945	0	Because look at the mess that we're in.
946	0	Look at the mess that we're in.
947	0	"As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said."
948	0	"We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not."
949	0	I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.
950	0	"She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was."
951	0	"I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China."
952	0	It could also be lots of other people.
953	0	"It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?"
954	0	You don't know who broke in to DNC.
955	0	But what did we learn with DNC?
956	0	"We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz."
957	0	Look what happened to her.
958	0	But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of.
959	0	That's what we learned.
960	0	"Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over."
961	0	"We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game."
962	0	ISIS.
963	0	"So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare."
964	0	It is -- it is a huge problem.
965	0	I have a son.
966	0	He's 10 years old.
967	0	He has computers.
968	0	"He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable."
969	0	"The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough."
970	0	And maybe it's hardly doable.
971	0	"But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing."
972	0	But that's true throughout our whole governmental society.
973	0	"We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them."
974	0	Secretary Clinton?
975	0	"Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing."
976	0	I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS.
977	0	It does involve going after them online.
978	0	"I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere."
979	0	"But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate."
980	0	We're making progress.
981	0	Our military is assisting in Iraq.
982	0	"And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria."
983	0	"But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority."
984	0	And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership.
985	0	"I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden."
986	0	"And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles."
987	0	"Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online."
988	0	"You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando."
989	0	I'll ask this to both of you.
990	0	"Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?"
991	0	"Well, first I have to say one thing, very important."
992	0	Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS.
993	0	We will take out ISIS.
994	0	"Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster."
995	0	And ISIS was formed.
996	0	So she talks about taking them out.
997	0	She's been doing it a long time.
998	0	She's been trying to take them out for a long time.
999	0	"But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that."
1000	0	And then you wouldn't have had them.
1001	0	"Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income."
1002	1	"And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters."
1003	0	Secretary Clinton?
1004	0	"Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard."
1005	0	Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.
1006	0	Wrong.
1007	0	That is absolutely proved over and over again.
1008	0	Wrong.
1009	0	Wrong.
1010	0	"He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time."
1011	0	"But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama."
1012	0	"And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that."
1013	0	"But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester."
1014	0	"The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States?"
1015	0	That's the most important part of this.
1016	0	How do we prevent attacks?
1017	0	How do we protect our people?
1018	0	"And I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information."
1019	0	"I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey."
1020	0	"You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami."
1021	0	And they brought him down.
1022	0	"And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit."
1023	0	"So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East."
1024	0	"That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of."
1025	0	"We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism."
1026	0	"We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations."
1027	0	"Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community."
1028	0	They're on the front lines.
1029	0	They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else.
1030	0	"They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to."
1031	0	Mr. Trump...
1032	0	"Well, I have to respond."
1033	0	Please respond.
1034	0	"The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen."
1035	0	"You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess."
1036	0	"Under your direction, to a large extent."
1037	0	"But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly."
1038	0	They were choking on the sanctions.
1039	0	"And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going."
1040	0	"But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO?"
1041	0	"And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson."
1042	0	I did really well.
1043	0	But I have common sense.
1044	0	"And I said, well, I'll tell you."
1045	0	I haven't given lots of thought to NATO.
1046	0	But two things.
1047	0	"Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share."
1048	0	"Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract."
1049	0	"And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror."
1050	0	And I was very strong.
1051	0	And I said it numerous times.
1052	0	"And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division."
1053	0	And I think that's great.
1054	0	And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.
1055	0	It's a lot of money to protect other people.
1056	0	But I'm all for NATO.
1057	0	"But I said they have to focus on terror, also."
1058	0	And they're going to do that.
1059	0	And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.
1060	1	"I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton."
1061	1	"And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops."
1062	1	"Not only that, you named the day."
1063	0	They couldn't believe it.
1064	0	"They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it."
1065	0	They said...
1066	0	"Lester, we've covered..."
1067	0	"No, wait a minute."
1068	0	We've covered this ground.
1069	0	"When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened."
1070	0	It should have never happened.
1071	0	"Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS."
1072	0	"But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant."
1073	0	Now it's in over 30 countries.
1074	0	And you're going to stop them?
1075	0	I don't think so.
1076	0	"Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions."
1077	0	You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion.
1078	0	What makes your...
1079	0	I did not support the war in Iraq.
1080	0	In 2002...
1081	0	"That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media."
1082	0	"My question is, since you supported it..."
1083	0	Just -- would you like to hear...
1084	0	why is your -- why is your judgment...
1085	0	Wait a minute.
1086	1	I was against the war in Iraq.
1087	0	Just so you put it out.
1088	0	"The record shows otherwise, but why -- why was..."
1089	0	The record does not show that.
1090	0	Why was -- is your judgment any...
1091	0	The record shows that I'm right.
1092	0	"When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows?"
1093	0	Essentially.
1094	0	I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto.
1095	0	We talked about the economy is more important.
1096	0	"I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity."
1097	0	I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox.
1098	1	"And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war."
1099	0	Why is your judgment better than...
1100	0	And when he -- excuse me.
1101	0	And that was before the war started.
1102	0	"Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him."
1103	1	I was against the war.
1104	0	"He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war."
1105	0	"And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there."
1106	0	But nobody called Sean Hannity.
1107	0	"And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started."
1108	0	I think in '04.
1109	0	But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.
1110	0	"And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt."
1111	0	"But if somebody -- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started."
1112	0	He and I used to have arguments about the war.
1113	0	"I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing."
1114	0	It's going to destabilize the Middle East.
1115	0	And that's exactly what it's done.
1116	0	It's been a disaster.
1117	0	"My reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was..."
1118	0	"No, no."
1119	0	You didn't hear what I said.
1120	0	Why is your judgment -- why is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton's judgment?
1121	0	"Well, I have much better judgment than she does."
1122	0	There's no question about that.
1123	0	"I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?"
1124	0	(LAUGHTER)
1125	0	"I have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after -- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament."
1126	0	I have a winning temperament.
1127	0	I know how to win.
1128	0	She does not have a...
1129	0	Secretary Clinton?
1130	0	Wait.
1131	0	"The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control."
1132	0	"I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem."
1133	0	Secretary Clinton?
1134	0	"Whew, OK."
1135	0	(LAUGHTER)
1136	0	"Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO."
1137	0	"You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all."
1138	0	And you know the only time it's ever been invoked?
1139	0	"After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side."
1140	0	"With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb."
1141	0	They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.
1142	0	They had built covert facilities.
1143	0	They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.
1144	0	And we had sanctioned them.
1145	0	"I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough."
1146	0	So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.
1147	0	And we did drive them to the negotiating table.
1148	0	"And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot."
1149	0	That's diplomacy.
1150	0	That's coalition-building.
1151	0	That's working with other nations.
1152	0	"The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship."
1153	0	"He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war."
1154	0	That's not good judgment.
1155	0	That would not start a war.
1156	0	"That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted."
1157	0	And the worst part...
1158	0	"No, they were taunting us."
1159	0	of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons.
1160	0	"He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia."
1161	0	"It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons."
1162	0	"He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine..."
1163	0	Wrong.
1164	0	"have a good time, folks."
1165	0	It's lies.
1166	0	"And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling."
1167	0	That is the number-one threat we face in the world.
1168	0	And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material.
1169	0	"So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned."
1170	0	"That line's getting a little bit old, I must say."
1171	0	I would like to...
1172	0	"It's a good one, though."
1173	0	It well describes the problem.
1174	0	(LAUGHTER)
1175	0	It's not an accurate one at all.
1176	0	It's not an accurate one.
1177	0	So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond.
1178	0	I agree with her on one thing.
1179	0	"The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks."
1180	0	Nuclear is the single greatest threat.
1181	0	"Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries."
1182	0	They do not pay us.
1183	0	"But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune."
1184	0	That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything.
1185	0	"I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything."
1186	0	"All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing."
1187	0	"We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million..."
1188	0	We need to move on.
1189	0	"Well, wait, but it's very important."
1190	0	"All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out."
1191	0	We're a country that owes $20 trillion.
1192	0	They have to help us out.
1193	0	Our last...
1194	0	"As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree."
1195	0	It is the single greatest threat that this country has.
1196	0	"Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here (inaudible) the subject of securing America."
1197	0	"On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation's longstanding policy on first use."
1198	0	Do you support the current policy?
1199	0	"Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that."
1200	0	"Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries."
1201	0	But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do.
1202	0	We have not been updating from the new standpoint.
1203	0	I looked the other night.
1204	0	"I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them."
1205	0	We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.
1206	0	"I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it."
1207	0	But I would certainly not do first strike.
1208	0	"I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over."
1209	0	"At the same time, we have to be prepared."
1210	0	I can't take anything off the table.
1211	0	"Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there."
1212	0	China should solve that problem for us.
1213	0	China should go into North Korea.
1214	0	China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.
1215	0	"And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal."
1216	0	Iran is one of their biggest trading partners.
1217	0	Iran has power over North Korea.
1218	0	"And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea."
1219	0	And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.
1220	0	"And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that?"
1221	0	Why didn't you add other things into the deal?
1222	1	"One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash."
1223	0	Nobody's ever seen that before.
1224	0	That turned out to be wrong.
1225	1	"It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages."
1226	0	It certainly looks that way.
1227	0	"So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal?"
1228	0	This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.
1229	0	The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems.
1230	0	"All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much."
1231	0	Your two minutes is expired.
1232	0	And they're going to end up getting nuclear.
1233	0	I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day.
1234	0	"Believe me, he's not a happy camper."
1235	0	All right.
1236	0	"Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes."
1237	0	"Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter."
1238	0	Words matter when you run for president.
1239	0	And they really matter when you are president.
1240	0	And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.
1241	0	It is essential that America's word be good.
1242	0	And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe.
1243	0	I've talked with a number of them.
1244	0	"But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good."
1245	0	It's also important that we look at the entire global situation.
1246	0	There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran.
1247	0	"But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that."
1248	0	And Donald never tells you what he would do.
1249	0	Would he have started a war?
1250	0	Would he have bombed Iran?
1251	0	"If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be."
1252	0	But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS.
1253	0	"He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan."
1254	0	So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues.
1255	0	"People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do."
1256	0	Can they rely on us?
1257	0	Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values?
1258	0	That's what I intend to do.
1259	0	"I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home."
1260	0	We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...
1261	0	Your two minutes is...
1262	0	to be given any opportunities at all.
1263	0	is expired.
1264	0	"Lester, one thing I'd like to say."
1265	0	Very quickly.
1266	0	Twenty seconds.
1267	0	I will go very quickly.
1268	0	"But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place."
1269	0	"Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations."
1270	0	Mr. Trump...
1271	0	And it's a big problem.
1272	0	"And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars."
1273	0	We cannot be the policemen of the world.
1274	0	We cannot protect countries all over the world...
1275	0	We have just...
1276	0	where they're not paying us what we need.
1277	0	We have just a few final questions...
1278	0	"And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability."
1279	0	We need heart.
1280	0	We need a lot of things.
1281	0	But you have to have some basic ability.
1282	0	"And sadly, she doesn't have that."
1283	0	"All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power."
1284	0	But they weren't taken care of.
1285	0	"And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of."
1286	0	"Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party."
1287	0	"Earlier this month, you said she doesn't have, quote, ""a presidential look."""
1288	0	She's standing here right now.
1289	0	What did you mean by that?
1290	0	She doesn't have the look.
1291	0	She doesn't have the stamina.
1292	0	I said she doesn't have the stamina.
1293	0	And I don't believe she does have the stamina.
1294	0	"To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina."
1295	0	"The quote was, ""I just don't think she has the presidential look."""
1296	0	You have -- wait a minute.
1297	0	"Wait a minute, Lester."
1298	0	You asked me a question.
1299	0	Did you ask me a question?
1300	0	You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals.
1301	0	"You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia."
1302	0	"I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia?"
1303	0	"And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying?"
1304	0	All you have to do is speak to them.
1305	0	Wait.
1306	0	"You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina."
1307	0	Let's let her respond.
1308	0	"Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina."
1309	0	(APPLAUSE)
1310	0	The world -- let me tell you.
1311	0	Let me tell you.
1312	0	"Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience."
1313	0	"We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree."
1314	0	(APPLAUSE)
1315	0	"But it's bad, bad experience."
1316	0	"Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal."
1317	0	I agree.
1318	0	"She's got experience, but it's bad experience."
1319	0	And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.
1320	0	We are at -- we are at the final question.
1321	0	(APPLAUSE)
1322	0	"Well, one thing."
1323	0	"One thing, Lester."
1324	0	"Very quickly, because we're at the final question now."
1325	0	"You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina."
1326	0	"But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said..."
1327	0	I never said that.
1328	1	women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.
1329	0	I didn't say that.
1330	0	And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest.
1331	0	"He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them."
1332	0	"And he called this woman ""Miss Piggy."""
1333	0	"Then he called her ""Miss Housekeeping,"" because she was Latina."
1334	0	"Donald, she has a name."
1335	0	Where did you find this?
1336	0	Where did you find this?
1337	0	Her name is Alicia Machado.
1338	0	Where did you find this?
1339	0	"And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet..."
1340	0	"Oh, really?"
1341	0	she's going to vote this November.
1342	0	"OK, good."
1343	0	Let me just tell you...
1344	0	(APPLAUSE)
1345	0	"Mr. Trump, could we just take 10 seconds and then we ask the final question..."
1346	0	"You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials."
1347	0	Some of it's said in entertainment.
1348	0	"Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her."
1349	0	But you want to know the truth?
1350	0	I was going to say something...
1351	0	Please very quickly.
1352	0	"... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, ""I can't do it."
1353	0	I just can't do it.
1354	0	It's inappropriate.
1355	0	"It's not nice."""
1356	0	"But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue."
1357	0	They're untrue.
1358	0	And they're misrepresentations.
1359	0	"And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice."
1360	0	And I don't deserve that.
1361	0	But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done.
1362	0	It's hundreds of millions of ads.
1363	0	"And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money..."
1364	0	We have to move on to the final question.
1365	0	"$200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing."
1366	0	(APPLAUSE)
1367	0	One of you will not win this election.
1368	0	"So my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters?"
1369	0	Secretary Clinton?
1370	0	"Well, I support our democracy."
1371	0	"And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose."
1372	0	But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.
1373	0	"And I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you."
1374	0	It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want.
1375	0	"So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does."
1376	0	"Mr. Trump, very quickly, same question."
1377	0	Will you accept the outcome as the will of the voters?
1378	0	I want to make America great again.
1379	0	We are a nation that is seriously troubled.
1380	0	We're losing our jobs.
1381	0	People are pouring into our country.
1382	0	"The other day, we were deporting 800 people."
1383	0	"And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens."
1384	0	Ended up becoming citizens.
1385	0	And it was 800.
1386	0	"And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know."
1387	0	Will you accept the outcome of the election?
1388	0	"Look, here's the story."
1389	0	I want to make America great again.
1390	0	I'm going to be able to do it.
1391	0	I don't believe Hillary will.
1392	0	"The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her."
1393	0	(APPLAUSE)
1394	0	All right.
1395	0	"Well, that is going to do it for us."
1396	0	"That concludes our debate for this evening, a spirit one."
1397	0	"We covered a lot of ground, not everything as I suspected we would."
1398	0	The next presidential debates are scheduled for October 9th at Washington University in St. Louis and October 19th at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.
1399	0	The conversation will continue.
1400	0	A reminder.
1401	0	"The vice presidential debate is scheduled for October 4th at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia."
1402	0	My thanks to Hillary Clinton and to Donald Trump and to Hofstra University for hosting us tonight.
1403	0	"Good night, everyone."
1	0	Good evening.
2	0	"From Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, and welcome to the first, and only, vice presidential debate of 2016, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates."
3	0	"I'm Elaine Quijano, anchor at CBSN, and correspondent for CBS News."
4	0	It's an honor to moderate this debate between Senator Tim Kaine and Governor Mike Pence.
5	0	Both are longtime public servants who are also proud fathers of sons serving in the U.S. Marines.
6	0	The campaigns have agreed to the rules of this 90-minute debate.
7	0	There will be nine different segments covering domestic and foreign policy issues.
8	0	Each segment will begin with a question to both candidates who will each have two minutes to answer.
9	0	Then I'll ask follow-up questions to facilitate a discussion between the candidates.
10	0	"By coin toss, it's been determined that Senator Kaine will be first to answer the opening question."
11	0	We have an enthusiastic audience tonight.
12	0	They've agreed to only express that enthusiasm once at the end of the debate and right now as we welcome Governor Mike Pence and Senator Tim Kaine.
13	0	(APPLAUSE)
14	0	"Gentlemen, welcome."
15	0	It truly is a privilege to be with both of you tonight.
16	0	I'd like to start with the topic of presidential leadership.
17	0	"Twenty-eight years ago tomorrow night, Lloyd Bentsen said the vice presidential debate was not about the qualifications for the vice presidency, but about how if tragedy should occur, the vice president has to step in without any margin for error, without time for preparation, to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in the world."
18	0	"What about your qualities, your skills, and your temperament equip you to step into that role at a moment's notice?"
19	0	Senator Kaine?
20	0	"Elaine, thank you for being here tonight, and, Governor Pence, welcome."
21	0	"It is so great to be back at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia."
22	0	This is a very special place.
23	0	"Sixty-five years ago, a young, courageous woman, Barbara Johns, led a walkout of her high school, Moton High School."
24	0	She made history by protesting school segregation.
25	0	She believed our nation was stronger together.
26	0	And that walkout led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision that moved us down the path toward equality.
27	0	"I am so proud to be running with another strong, history-making woman, Hillary Clinton, to be president of the United States."
28	0	"I'm proud because her vision of stronger together, building an economy that works for all, not just those at the top, being safe in the world not only with a strong military, but also strong alliances to battle terrorism and climate change, and also to build a community of respect, just like Barbara Johns tried to do 65 years ago."
29	0	That's why I'm so proud to be her running mate.
30	0	Hillary told me why she asked me to be her running mate.
31	0	She said the test of a Clinton administration will not be the signing of a bill or the passage of a bill.
32	0	"It'll be whether we can make somebody's life better, whether we can make a classroom better learning environment for schoolkids or teachers, whether we can make a safer -- it's going to be about results."
33	0	"And she said to me, you've been a missionary and a civil rights lawyer."
34	0	You've been a city councilman and mayor.
35	0	You've been a lieutenant governor and governor and now a U.S. senator.
36	0	I think you will help me figure out how to govern this nation so that we always keep in mind that the success of the administration is the difference we make in people's lives.
37	0	"And that's what I bring to the ticket, that experience having served at all levels of government."
38	0	But my primary role is to be Hillary Clinton's right-hand person and strong supporter as she puts together the most historic administration possible.
39	0	And I relish that role.
40	0	I'm so proud of her.
41	0	"I'll just say this: We trust Hillary Clinton, my wife and I, and we trust her with the most important thing in our life."
42	0	We have a son deployed overseas in the Marine Corps right now.
43	0	"We trust Hillary Clinton as president and commander-in-chief, but the thought of Donald Trump as commander-in-chief scares us to death."
44	0	Governor Pence?
45	0	"Well, first off, thank you, Elaine, and thank you to -- thank you to Norwood University for their wonderful hospitality and the Commission on Presidential Debates."
46	0	"It's deeply humbling for me to be here, to be surrounded by my -- my wonderful family."
47	0	"And, Senator Kaine, it's an honor to be here with you, as well."
48	0	"And I just -- I also want to say -- I want to say thanks to everyone that's looking in tonight, who understands what an enormously important time this is in the life of our nation."
49	0	"For the last seven-and-a-half years, we've seen America's place in the world weakened."
50	0	"We've seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal, and a failing health care reform come to be known as Obamacare, and the American people know that we need to make a change."
51	0	And so I want to thank all of you for being -- being with us tonight.
52	0	I also want to thank Donald Trump for making that call and inviting us to be a part of this ticket.
53	0	"I have to tell you, I'm a -- I'm a small-town boy from a place not too different from Farmville."
54	0	I grew up with a cornfield in my backyard.
55	0	My grandfather had immigrated to this country when he was about my son's age.
56	0	My mom and dad built a -- everything that matters in a small town in Southern Indiana.
57	0	They built a family and -- and a good name and a business.
58	0	And they raised a family.
59	0	"And I dreamed some day of representing my home town in Washington, D.C., but I -- honestly, Elaine, I never imagined -- never imagined I'd have the opportunity to be governor of the state that I love, let alone be sitting at a table like this in this kind of a position."
60	0	"So to answer your question, I would say I -- I would hope that if -- if the responsibility ever fell to me in this role, that I would meet it with the way that I'm going to meet the responsibility should I be elected vice president of the United States."
61	0	"And that's to bring a lifetime of experience, a lifetime growing up in a small town, a lifetime where I've served in the Congress of the United States, where -- where I've led a state that works in the great state of Indiana, and whatever other responsibilities might follow from this, I -- I would hope and, frankly, I would pray to be able to meet that moment with that -- that lifetime of experience."
62	0	"Senator Kaine, on the campaign trail, you praised Secretary Clinton's character, including her commitment to public service, yet 60 percent of voters don't think she's trustworthy."
63	0	Why do so many people distrust her?
64	0	Is it because they have questions about her e-mails and the Clinton Foundation?
65	0	"Elaine, let me tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton."
66	0	Here's what people should look at as they look at a public servant.
67	0	Do they have a passion in their life that showed up before they were in public life?
68	0	"And have they held onto that passion throughout their life, regardless of whether they were in office or not, succeeding or failing?"
69	0	Hillary Clinton has that passion.
70	0	"From a time as a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago, she has been focused on serving others with a special focus on empowering families and kids."
71	0	"As a civil rights lawyer in the South, with the Children's Defense Fund, first lady of Arkansas and this country, senator, secretary of state, it's always been about putting others first."
72	0	And that's a sharp contrast with Donald Trump.
73	0	Donald Trump always puts himself first.
74	0	"He built a business career, in the words of one of his own campaign staffers, ""off the backs of the little guy."""
75	0	"And as a candidate, he started his campaign with a speech where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals, and he has pursued the discredited and really outrageous lie that President Obama wasn't born in the United States."
76	0	It is so painful to suggest that we go back to think about these days where an African-American could not be a citizen of the United States.
77	0	"And I can't imagine how Governor Pence can defend the insult- driven selfish ""me first"" style of Donald Trump."
78	0	"Governor Pence, let me ask you, you have said Donald Trump is, quote, ""thoughtful, compassionate, and steady."""
79	0	"Yet 67 percent of voters feel he is a risky choice, and 65 percent feel he does not have the right kind of temperament to be president."
80	0	Why do so many Americans think Mr. Trump is simply too erratic?
81	0	"Well, let me -- let me say first and foremost that, Senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an insult- driven campaign."
82	0	It really is remarkable.
83	0	"At a time when literally, in the wake of Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, where she was the architect of the Obama administration's foreign policy, we see entire portions of the world, particularly the wider Middle East, literally spinning out of control."
84	0	"I mean, the situation we're watching hour by hour in Syria today is the result of the failed foreign policy and the weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead in this administration and create."
85	0	"The newly emboldened -- the aggression of Russia, whether it was in Ukraine or now they're heavy-handed approach..."
86	0	You guys love Russia.
87	0	You both have said...
88	0	their heavy-handed approach.
89	0	You both have said -- you both have said Vladimir Putin is a better leader than the president.
90	0	Well...
91	0	(CROSSTALK)
92	0	"Well, we're going to get to Russia in just a moment."
93	0	But I do want to get back to the question at...
94	0	"But in the midst -- Elaine, thank you."
95	0	Thank you.
96	0	"Thank you, Senator, I'll..."
97	0	These guys have praised Vladimir Putin as a great leader.
98	0	How can that...
99	0	(CROSSTALK)
100	0	"Yes, and we will get to that, Senator."
101	0	We do have that coming up here.
102	0	"But in the meantime, the questions..."
103	0	"Well, Senator, I must have hit a..."
104	0	(CROSSTALK)
105	0	I must have hit a nerve here.
106	0	Why the disconnect?
107	0	"Because at a time of great challenge in the life of this nation, where we've weakened America's place in the world, stifled America's economy, the campaign of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine has been an avalanche of insults."
108	0	"Look, to get to your question about trustworthiness, Donald Trump has built a business through hard times and through good times."
109	0	He's brought an extraordinary business acumen.
110	0	He's employed tens of thousands of people in this country.
111	0	And paid few taxes and lost a billion a year.
112	0	(CROSSTALK)
113	0	And why the disconnect with your running mate?
114	0	But there's a -- there's a reason why people question the trustworthiness of Hillary Clinton.
115	0	And that's because they're paying attention.
116	0	"I mean, the reality is, when she was secretary of state, Senator, come on."
117	0	She had a Clinton Foundation accepting contributions from foreign governments.
118	0	You are Donald Trump's apprentice.
119	0	Let me talk about this...
120	0	(CROSSTALK)
121	0	"Senator, I think I'm still on my time."
122	0	"Well, I think -- isn't this a discussion?"
123	0	This is our open discussion.
124	0	"Yeah, let's talk about the state of..."
125	0	(CROSSTALK)
126	0	"Well, let me interrupt -- let me interrupt you and finish my sentence, if I can."
127	0	Finish your sentence.
128	0	The Clinton Foundation accepted foreign contributions from foreign governments and foreign donors while she was secretary of state.
129	0	"OK, now I can weigh in."
130	0	Now...
131	0	She had a private server...
132	0	"Now, I get to weigh in."
133	0	"Now, let me just say this..."
134	0	that was discovered...
135	0	(CROSSTALK)
136	0	"Senator, you have an opportunity to respond."
137	0	keep that pay to play process out of the reach of the public.
138	0	"Governor Pence -- Governor Pence doesn't think the world's going so well and he, you know, is going to say it's everybody's fault."
139	0	Do you?
140	0	Let me tell you this.
141	0	"When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, Governor Pence, did you know that Osama bin Laden was alive?"
142	0	Yes.
143	0	"Do you know that we had 175,000 troops deployed in the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan?"
144	0	Do you know that Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon and Russia was expanding its stockpile?
145	0	"Under Secretary Clinton's leadership, she was part of the national team, public safety team that went after and revived the dormant hunt against bin Laden and wiped him off the face of the Earth."
146	1	She worked to deal with the Russians to reduce their chemical weapons stockpile.
147	1	She worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot.
148	0	Eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program?
149	0	"Absolutely, without firing a shot."
150	0	"And instead of 175,000 American troops deployed overseas, we now have 15,000."
151	0	Right and...
152	0	"These are very, very good things."
153	0	"And Iraq has been overrun by ISIS, because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate..."
154	0	"Well, if you want to put more American troops in Iraq, you can propose that."
155	0	Hillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement...
156	0	"No, that is incorrect."
157	0	That's incorrect.
158	0	And so we removed -- we removed all of our...
159	0	"Gentlemen, we'll get to..."
160	0	(CROSSTALK)
161	0	"troops from Iraq, and ISIS was able to be conjured up in that vacuum."
162	0	But I'd like to correct...
163	0	and overrun vast areas of Iraq.
164	1	"Governor, President Bush said we would leave Iraq at the end of 2011."
165	1	"And, Elaine, Iraq didn't want our troops to stay, and they wouldn't give us the protection for our troops."
166	0	And guess what?
167	0	"If a nation where our troops are serving does not want us to stay, we're not going to stay without their protection."
168	0	It was a failure of the secretary of state...
169	0	"We need to move on to the next topic, gentlemen."
170	0	"If Governor Pence wants to put more troops back in Iraq, that's..."
171	0	There are a lot of people wondering in this country about the economy.
172	0	Let's turn to the issue of the economy.
173	0	OK.
174	0	"According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, neither of your economic plans will reduce the growing $19 trillion gross national debt."
175	0	"In fact, your plans would add even more to it."
176	0	Both of you were governors who balanced state budgets.
177	0	Are you concerned that adding more to the debt could be disastrous for the country.
178	0	Governor Pence?
179	0	"I think the fact that -- that under this past administration was of which Hillary Clinton was a part, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious."
180	0	"I mean, I'm very proud of the fact that -- I come from a state that works."
181	1	The state of Indiana has balanced budgets.
182	1	"We cut taxes, we've made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank."
183	0	That's a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia.
184	0	He actually -- he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion.
185	0	He left his state about $2 billion in the hole.
186	1	"In the state of Indiana, we've cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor."
187	0	"But I think he's a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton, because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same."
188	0	"It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that."
189	0	You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful.
190	0	"But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan."
191	0	But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare.
192	0	They want to expand it into a single-payer program.
193	0	"And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start."
194	0	"Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy."
195	0	We can get America moving again.
196	0	"Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that'll put the American worker first, and you've got a prescription for real growth."
197	0	"And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that's when you can deal with the national debt."
198	0	"When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth with Donald Trump's plan will do, then we're going to have the resources to meet our nation's needs at home and abroad, and we're going to have the ability to bring down the national debt."
199	0	Senator Kaine?
200	0	"Elaine, on the economy, there's a fundamental choice for the American electorate."
201	0	"Do you want a ""you're hired"" president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a ""you're fired"" president in Donald Trump?"
202	0	I think that's not such a hard choice.
203	0	"Hillary and I have a plan that's on the table that's a ""you're hired"" plan."
204	0	Five components.
205	0	"First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow."
206	0	"Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year."
207	0	"Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can't work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work."
208	0	"Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as we've done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses."
209	0	Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families.
210	0	"My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight."
211	0	"And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who've benefited as we've come out of recession to pay more."
212	0	The Trump plan is a different plan.
213	0	"It's a ""you're fired"" plan."
214	0	And there's two key elements to it.
215	1	"First, Donald Trump said wages are too high."
216	0	And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage.
217	0	"Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15."
218	0	And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana.
219	0	"The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump."
220	0	"The problem with this, Elaine, is that's exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession -- the deepest recession since the 1930s."
221	1	Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs.
222	1	The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs.
223	0	And Donald Trump -- why would he do this?
224	0	Because his tax plan basically helps him.
225	0	"And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan."
226	0	"On that point, Governor Pence, recently the New York Times released part of Mr. Trump's 1995 tax return and reported that he could have avoided paying federal income taxes for years."
227	0	"Yesterday, Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible."
228	0	Does that seem fair to you?
229	0	"Well, first, let me say, I appreciated the ""you're hired,"" ""you're fired"" thing, Senator."
230	0	You use that a whole lot.
231	0	And I think your running mate used a lot of pre-done lines.
232	0	"Look, what -- what you all just heard out there is more taxes, $2 trillion in more spending, more deficits, more debt, more government."
233	0	"And if you think that's all working, then you look at the other side of the table."
234	0	"I mean, the truth of the matter is, the policies of this administration, which Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine want to continue, have run this economy into a ditch."
235	0	We're in the...
236	1	Fifteen million new jobs?
237	0	slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression.
238	1	Fifteen million new jobs?
239	0	Governor...
240	0	(CROSSTALK)
241	0	There are millions more people living in poverty today than the day that Barack Obama with Hillary Clinton at his side...
242	0	And the poverty level and the median income...
243	0	stepped into the Oval Office.
244	0	improved dramatically between 2014 and 2015.
245	0	"You -- honestly, Senator, you can roll out the numbers and the sunny side, but I got to tell you, people in Scranton know different."
246	0	"People in Fort Wayne, Indiana, know different."
247	0	"I mean, this economy is struggling."
248	0	The answer to this economy is not more taxes.
249	0	But it's not the giveaway tax relief to the folks at the top.
250	0	It's not more spending...
251	0	(CROSSTALK)
252	0	I am interested to hear whether he'll defend his running mate's not releasing taxes and not paying taxes.
253	0	Absolutely I will.
254	0	"Governor, with all due respect, the question was about whether it seems fair to you that Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible."
255	0	"Well, this is probably the difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine."
256	0	"And, I mean, Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine -- God bless you for it, career public servants, that's great -- Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician."
257	0	He actually built a business.
258	0	Those tax returns that were -- that came out publicly this week show that he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago.
259	0	"But like virtually every other business, including the New York Times not too long ago, he used what's called net operating loss."
260	0	"We have a tax code, Senator, that actually is designed to encourage entrepreneurship in this country."
261	0	But why won't he release his tax returns?
262	0	"Well, we're answering the question about -- about a business thing, is he..."
263	0	"I do want to come back to that, but..."
264	0	"His tax returns -- his tax returns showed he went through a very difficult time, but he used the tax code just the way it's supposed to be used."
265	0	And he did it brilliantly.
266	0	How do you know that?
267	0	You haven't seen his tax returns.
268	0	He created a runway -- because he's created a business that's worth billions of dollars today.
269	0	How do you know that?
270	0	"And with regard to paying taxes, this whole riff about not paying taxes and people saying he didn't pay taxes for years, Donald Trump has created tens of thousands of jobs."
271	0	"And he's paid payroll taxes, sales taxes, property taxes..."
272	0	"Elaine, let me talk about something."
273	0	"Senator, I'm going to give you about 30 seconds to respond, and I have question on Social Security for you."
274	0	OK.
275	0	"The only issue on taxes -- Hillary Clinton is going to raise taxes, and Donald Trump and I are going to cut them."
276	0	"Donald Trump started this campaign in 2014 and he said, ""If I run for president, I will absolutely release my taxes."""
277	0	He's broken his first...
278	0	And he will.
279	0	He's broken his first promise.
280	0	"Second, he stood on the stage..."
281	0	He hasn't broken his promise.
282	0	He said he's...
283	0	"He stood on the stage last week and when Hillary said, you haven't been paying taxes, he said, ""That makes me smart."""
284	0	So it's smart not to pay for our military?
285	0	It's smart not to pay for veterans?
286	0	It's smart not to pay for teachers?
287	0	"And I guess all of us who do pay for those things, I guess we're stupid."
288	0	And the last thing I'll say is this...
289	0	"Senator, do you take all the deductions that you're entitled to?"
290	0	The last thing -- the last thing I want to ask Governor Pence is...
291	0	I do.
292	0	Governor Pence had to give Donald Trump his tax returns to show he was qualified to be vice president.
293	0	Donald Trump must give the American public his tax returns to show that he's qualified to be president.
294	0	And he's breaking his promise.
295	0	"Elaine, I have to respond to this."
296	0	"You get very little time, 20 seconds."
297	0	I'll be -- I'll be very respectful.
298	0	Governor?
299	0	"Look, Donald Trump has filed over 100 pages of financial disclosure, which is what the law requires."
300	0	But he said he would release his tax returns.
301	0	"All right, Gentlemen..."
302	0	The American people can review that.
303	0	"And he's going -- Senator, he's going to release his tax returns when the audit is over..."
304	0	I need to ask you about Social Security...
305	1	Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit.
306	0	They're going to raise your taxes.
307	0	We're going to cut your taxes.
308	0	Gentlemen...
309	0	If you can't meet Nixon's standard...
310	0	The people at home cannot understand either one of you when you speak over each other.
311	0	I would please ask you to wait until it is that the other is finished.
312	0	All right.
313	0	We're having fun up here.
314	0	"Senator Kaine, on the issue of Social Security, in 18 years, when the Social Security Trust Funds run out of money, you'll be 76."
315	0	"The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates your benefits could be cut by as much as $7,500 per year."
316	0	What would your administration do to prevent this cut?
317	0	"First, we're going to protect Social Security, which is one of the greatest programs that the American government has ever done."
318	0	"It happened at a time when you would work your whole life, your whole life, raising your kids, working, being a Little League coach or a Sunday school teacher, and then you would retire into poverty."
319	0	And Social Security has enabled people to retire with dignity and overwhelmingly not be in poverty.
320	0	We have to keep it solvent.
321	0	And we will keep it solvent.
322	0	And we'll look for strategies like adjusting the payroll tax cap upward in order to do that.
323	0	Here's what Hillary and I will not do.
324	0	And I want to make this very plain.
325	0	"We will never, ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security."
326	0	Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us.
327	0	"And when Congressman Pence was in Congress, he was the chief cheerleader for the privatization of Social Security."
328	0	"Even after President Bush stopped pushing for it, Congressman Pence kept pushing for it."
329	0	We're going to stand up against efforts to privatize Social Security.
330	0	"And we'll look for ways to keep it solvent going forward, focusing primarily on the payroll tax cap."
331	0	"Governor Pence, I'll give you an opportunity to respond."
332	0	"Well, thanks, Elaine."
333	0	There they go again.
334	0	OK...
335	0	Go read -- go read the book.
336	0	All Donald Trump -- all Donald Trump and I have said about Social Security is we're going to meet our obligations to our seniors.
337	0	That's it.
338	0	Go read the book.
339	0	We've said we're going to meet the obligations of Medicare.
340	0	"That's what this campaign is really about, Senator."
341	0	"And I get, this is -- this is the old scare tactic that they roll out..."
342	0	"But -- but you have a voting record, Governor."
343	0	And I get all of that.
344	0	"I just, look..."
345	0	I...
346	0	There's a question that you asked a little bit earlier that I want to go back to.
347	0	I can't believe that you won't defend your own voting record.
348	0	I have to go back to.
349	0	We...
350	0	"Well, look, I -- you're running with Hillary Clinton, who wants to raise taxes by $1 trillion, increase spending by $2 trillion, and you say you're going to keep the promises of Social Security."
351	0	Donald Trump and I are going to cut taxes.
352	0	We're going to -- we're going to -- we're going to...
353	1	You're not going to cut taxes.
354	1	You're going to raise taxes on the middle class.
355	0	reform government programs so we can meet the obligations of Social Security and Medicare.
356	0	All right.
357	0	"Stay on the path that your party has us on, we're going to be in a -- in a mountain range of debt."
358	0	And we're going to face hard choices and...
359	0	(CROSSTALK)
360	0	"Gentleman, I want to move on now."
361	0	"You did ask this question about debt, and the debt explosion on the Trump plan is much, much bigger than anything on the Clinton side."
362	0	All right.
363	0	Let me move on now...
364	0	Three hundred and five (ph) economists said your plan is bad for the economy.
365	0	to the issue of law enforcement and race relations.
366	0	Law enforcement and race relations.
367	0	"After the Dallas police shooting, Police Chief David Brown said, quote, ""We're asking cops to do too much in this country."
368	0	Every societal failure we put it off on the cops to solve.
369	0	"Not enough mental health funding, not enough drug addiction funding, schools fail, let's give it to the cops."""
370	0	Do we ask too much of police officers in this country?
371	0	And how would you specifically address the chief's concerns?
372	0	Senator Kaine?
373	0	"Elaine, I think that's a very fair comment."
374	0	I think we put a lot on police shoulders.
375	0	And this is something I got a lot of scar tissue and experience on.
376	0	I was a city councilman and mayor in Richmond.
377	0	"And when I came in, we had one of the highest homicide rates in the United States."
378	0	"We fought very, very hard over the course of my time in local office with our police department, and we reduced our homicide rate nearly in half."
379	0	"And then when I was governor of Virginia, we worked hard, too."
380	0	And we did something we had really wanted to do.
381	0	"For the first time ever, we cracked the top 10, 10 safest states, because we worked together."
382	0	Here's what I learned as a mayor and a governor.
383	0	The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing.
384	0	"You build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows."
385	0	"And when that gap narrows, it's safer for the communities and it's safer for the police."
386	0	"That model still works across our country, but there are some other models that don't work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model."
387	0	Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country.
388	0	That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community.
389	0	So here's what we'll do.
390	0	We'll focus on community policing.
391	0	"We will focus on -- and Hillary Clinton has rolled out a really comprehensive mental health reform package that she worked on with law enforcement professionals, and we will also fight the scourge of gun violence in the United States."
392	0	I'm a gun-owner.
393	0	I'm a strong Second Amendment supporter.
394	0	"But I've got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so we're going to work to do things like close background record checks."
395	0	"And if we do, we won't have the tragedies that we did."
396	0	One of those killed at Virginia Tech was a guy named Liviu Librescu.
397	0	He was a 70-plus-year-old Romanian Holocaust survivor.
398	0	He had survived the Holocaust.
399	0	Then he survived the Soviet Union takeover of his country.
400	0	"But then he was a visiting professor at Virginia Tech, and he couldn't survive the scourge of gun violence."
401	0	"We can support the Second Amendment and do things like background record checks and make us safer, and that will make police safer, too."
402	0	Governor Pence?
403	0	"You know, my uncle was a cop, a career cop, on the beat in downtown Chicago."
404	0	He was my hero when I was growing up.
405	0	And we'd go up to visit my dad's family in Chicago.
406	0	"My three brothers and I would marvel at my uncle when he would come out in his uniform, sidearm at his side."
407	0	Police officers are the best of us.
408	0	"And the men and women, white, African-American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day."
409	0	"And let my say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea."
410	0	It's worked in the Hoosier state.
411	0	And we fully support that.
412	0	Donald Trump and I are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation.
413	0	"It's probably -- probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States of America, because they see his commitment to them."
414	0	They see his commitment to law and order.
415	0	"But they also -- they also hear the bad mouthing, the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as -- as a reason to -- to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of -- of implicit bias or institutional racism."
416	0	And that really has got to stop.
417	0	"I mean, when an African-American police officer in Charlotte named Brentley Vinson, an all-star football player who went to Liberty University here in the state, came home, followed his dad into law enforcement, joined the force in Charlotte, joined the force in Charlotte in 2014, was involved in a police action shooting that claimed the life of Keith -- Keith Lamont Scott, it was a tragedy."
418	0	"I mean, I -- we -- we mourn with those who mourn."
419	0	We -- we grieve with those who grieve.
420	0	And we're saddened at the loss of life.
421	1	"But Hillary Clinton actually referred to that moment as an example of implicit bias in the police force, where -- where she used -- when she was asked in the debate a week ago whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement, her only answer was that there's implicit bias in everyone in the United States."
422	0	I just think...
423	0	Can I -- can I explain...
424	0	I just think what we ought to do is we ought to stop seizing on these moments of tragedy.
425	0	We ought to assure the public that we'll have a full and complete and transparent investigation whenever there's a loss of life because of police action.
426	0	"But, Senator, please, you know, enough of this seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly by making the accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs."
427	0	"Elaine -- Elaine, people shouldn't be afraid to bring up issues of bias in law enforcement."
428	0	And if you're afraid to have...
429	0	I'm not afraid to bring that up.
430	0	"And if -- if you're afraid to have the discussion, you'll never solve it."
431	0	"And so here's -- here's an example, heartbreaking."
432	0	We would agree this was a heartbreaking example.
433	0	"The guy, Philando Castile, who was killed in St. Paul, he was a worker, a valued worker in a local school."
434	0	And he was killed for no apparent reason in an incident that will be discussed and will be investigated.
435	0	"But when folks went and explored this situation, what they found is that Philando Castile, who was a -- they called him Mr. Rogers with Dreadlocks in the school that he worked."
436	0	The kids loved him.
437	0	But he had been stopped by police 40 or 50 times before that fatal incident.
438	0	"And if you look at sentencing in this country, African-Americans and Latinos get sentenced for the same crimes at very different rates."
439	0	We need criminal justice reform.
440	0	"Well, we do."
441	0	Indiana has passed criminal justice reform.
442	0	"But I just want to say, those who say that we should not..."
443	0	But that's not what you're talking about.
444	0	"we should not be able to bring up and talk about bias in the system, we'll never solve the problem..."
445	0	Governor Pence...
446	0	(CROSSTALK)
447	0	Governor Pence...
448	1	"Senator, when African-American police officers involved in a police action shooting involving an African-American, why would Hillary Clinton accuse that African-American police officer of implicit bias?"
449	0	"Well, I guess I can't believe you are defending the position that there is no bias and it's a topic we don't even..."
450	0	(CROSSTALK)
451	0	"Governor Pence, I have a question on that point."
452	0	I did not make that statement.
453	0	I...
454	0	"Your fellow Republican, Governor Pence, Senator Tim Scott, who is African-American, recently spoke on the Senate floor."
455	0	He said he was stopped seven times by law enforcement in one year.
456	0	A U.S. senator.
457	0	"He said, ""I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness, and the humiliation that comes with feeling like you're being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself."""
458	0	What would you say to Senator Scott about his experiences?
459	0	"Well, I have the deepest respect for Senator Scott, and he's a close friend."
460	0	And what I would say is that we -- we need to adopt criminal justice reform nationally.
461	0	"I -- I signed criminal justice reform in the state of Indiana, Senator, and we're very proud of it."
462	0	I worked when I was Congress on a second chance act.
463	0	We have got to do a better job recognizing and correcting the errors in the system that do reflect on institutional bias in criminal justice.
464	0	But what -- what -- what Donald Trump and I are saying is let's not have the reflex of assuming the worst of men and women in law enforcement.
465	0	We truly do believe that law enforcement is not a force for racism or division in our country...
466	0	"Elaine, can I..."
467	0	"So what would you say to Senator Scott, Governor?"
468	0	Law enforcement in this country is a force for good.
469	0	They are the -- they truly are people that put their lives on the line every single day.
470	0	"But I would -- I would suggest to you, what we need to do is assert a stronger leadership at the national level to support law enforcement."
471	0	You just heard Senator Kaine reject stop-and-frisk.
472	0	"Well, I would suggest to you that the families that live in our inner cities that are besieged by crime..."
473	0	"Elaine, let me -- let me..."
474	0	"Governor, the question is about Senator Scott."
475	0	What would -- what would you tell Senator Scott?
476	0	"Elaine, if I could -- if I could jump in."
477	0	I've heard Senator Scott make that eloquent plea.
478	0	"And look, criminal justice is about respecting the law and being respected by the law."
479	0	So there is a fundamental respect issue here.
480	0	And I just want to talk about the tone that's set from the top.
481	0	Donald Trump during his campaign has called Mexicans rapists and criminals.
482	0	"He's called women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting."
483	0	I don't like saying that in front of my wife and my mother.
484	0	He attacked an Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified to hear a federal lawsuit because his parents were Mexican.
485	0	"He went after John McCain, a POW, and said he wasn't hero because he'd been captured."
486	0	He said African-Americans are living in Hell.
487	0	And he perpetrated this outrageous and bigoted lie that President Obama is not a U.S. citizen.
488	0	"If you want to have a society where people are respected and respect laws, you can't have somebody at the top who demeans every group that he talks about."
489	0	"And I just -- again, I cannot believe that Governor Pence will defend the insult-driven campaign that Donald Trump has run."
490	0	All right.
491	0	"I want to turn to our next segment now, immigration."
492	0	Your running mates have both said that undocumented immigrants who have committed violent crimes should be deported.
493	0	What would you tell the millions of undocumented immigrants who have not committed violent crimes?
494	0	Governor Pence?
495	0	Donald Trump's laid out a plan to end illegal immigration once and for all in this country.
496	0	We've been talking it to death for 20 years.
497	0	"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to continue the policies of open borders, amnesty, catch and release, sanctuary cities, all the things that are driving -- that are driving wages down in this country, Senator, and also too often with criminal aliens in the country, it's bringing heartbreak."
498	0	"But I -- Donald Trump has a plan that he laid out in Arizona, that will deal systemically with illegal immigration, beginning with border security, internal enforcement."
499	0	"It's probably why for the first time in the history of Immigration and Customs Enforcement their union actually endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States, because they know they need help to enforce the laws of this country."
500	0	"And Donald Trump has laid out a priority to remove criminal aliens, remove people that have overstayed their visas."
501	0	"And -- and once we have accomplished all of that, which will -- which will strengthen our economy, strengthen the rule of law in the country and make our communities safer once the criminal aliens are out, then we'll deal with those that remain."
502	0	"But I have to tell you, I just -- I was listening to the avalanche of insults coming out of Senator Kaine a minute ago."
503	0	"These were Donald's -- hold on a second, Governor."
504	0	(CROSSTALK)
505	0	"It's my time, Senator."
506	0	"It is, in fact, the governor's time."
507	0	I apologize.
508	0	It's your two minutes.
509	0	I apologize.
510	0	Thanks.
511	0	I forgive you.
512	0	He says ours is an insult-driven campaign.
513	0	Did you all just hear that?
514	0	Ours is an insult-driven campaign?
515	0	"I mean, to be honest with you, if Donald Trump had said all of the things that you've said he said in the way you said he said them, he still wouldn't have a fraction of the insults that Hillary Clinton leveled when she said that half of our supporters were a basket of deplorables."
516	0	"It's -- she said they were irredeemable, they were not American."
517	0	"I mean, it's extraordinary."
518	0	"And then she labeled one after another ""ism"" on millions of Americans who believe that we can have a stronger America at home and abroad, who believe we can get this economy moving again, who believe that we can end illegal immigration once and for all."
519	0	"So, Senator, this -- this insult-driven campaign, I mean..."
520	0	Governor...
521	0	That's small potatoes compared to Hillary Clinton...
522	0	Senator Kaine?
523	0	calling half of Donald Trump's supporters a basket of deplorables.
524	0	"Hillary Clinton said something on the campaign trail, and the very next day, she said, you know what, I shouldn't have said that."
525	0	She said she shouldn't have said half.
526	0	"Governor, this is Senator Kaine's two minutes, please."
527	0	"Yeah, that's right, so now we're even."
528	0	Yeah.
529	0	(LAUGHTER)
530	0	Look for Donald trump apologizing to John McCain for saying he wasn't a hero...
531	0	Oh...
532	0	"to Donald Trump apologizing for calling women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting."
533	0	"She apologized for saying ""half."""
534	0	Governor.
535	0	"It is his two minutes, please."
536	0	Did Donald Trump apologize for taking after somebody in a Twitter war and making fun of her weight?
537	0	Did he apologize for saying African-Americans are living in Hell?
538	0	Did he apologize for saying President Obama was not even a citizen of the United States?
539	0	You will look in vain to see Donald Trump ever taking responsibility for anybody and apologizing.
540	0	Immigration.
541	0	There's two plans on the table.
542	0	Hillary and I believe in comprehensive immigration reform.
543	0	Donald Trump believes in deportation nation.
544	0	You've got to pick your choice.
545	0	"Hillary and I want a bipartisan reform that will put keeping families together as the top goal, second, that will help focus enforcement efforts on those who are violent, third, that will do more border control, and, fourth, that will provide a path to citizenship for those who work hard, pay taxes, play by the rules, and take criminal background record checks."
546	0	That's our proposal.
547	0	"Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people, 11 million who are here without documents."
548	0	And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship.
549	0	"So if you're born here, but your parents don't have documents, they want to eliminate that."
550	0	That's another 4.5 million people.
551	0	These guys -- and Donald Trump have said it -- deportation force.
552	0	"They want to go house to house, school to school, business to business, and kick out 16 million people."
553	0	And I cannot believe...
554	0	That's nonsense.
555	0	That's nonsense.
556	0	I cannot believe that Governor Pence would sit here and defend his running mate's claim that we should create a deportation force to -- so that they'll all be gone.
557	0	"Senator, we have a deportation force."
558	0	It's called Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.
559	0	And the union for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement for the first time in their history endorsed Donald Trump to be the next president of the United States of America.
560	0	So you like the 16 million deportations?
561	0	"Senator, that's -- that's nonsense."
562	1	"Look, what you just heard is they have a plan for open borders, amnesty."
563	0	That's...
564	0	(CROSSTALK)
565	0	Our plan is like Ronald Reagan's plan from 1986.
566	0	They call it comprehensive immigration reform -- they call it comprehensive immigration reform on Capitol Hill.
567	0	We all know the routine.
568	0	It's amnesty.
569	0	And you heard one of the last things he mentioned was border security.
570	0	That's how Washington always plays it.
571	0	"No, I..."
572	0	"They always say we're going to do this, we're going to do that, we'll eventually get the border..."
573	0	(CROSSTALK)
574	0	"border security three years ago, and Governor Pence was against it."
575	0	"Governor, Mr. Trump has said..."
576	0	Ronald Reagan said a nation without borders is not a nation.
577	0	"Donald Trump is committed to restoring the borders of this nation and securing our nation, enforcing our laws."
578	0	"So, Governor, how would these millions of undocumented immigrants leave?"
579	0	Would they be forcibly removed?
580	0	"Well, I think Donald Trump laid out a series of priorities that doesn't ends with border security."
581	0	It begins with border security.
582	0	"And after we secure the border, not only build a wall, but beneath the ground and in the air, we do internal enforcement."
583	0	But he said the focus has to be on criminal aliens.
584	0	We just -- we just had a conversation about law enforcement.
585	0	We just had a conversation about the -- the violence that's besetting our cities.
586	0	The reality is that there's heartbreak and tragedy that has struck American families because people that came into this country illegally are now involved in criminal enterprise and activity.
587	0	And we don't have the resources or the will to deport them systemically.
588	0	"Donald Trump has said we're going to move those people out, people who've overstayed their visas."
589	0	We're going to enforce the law of this country.
590	0	We're going to strengthen Immigrations and Customs Enforcements with more resources and more personnel to be able to do that.
591	0	"And then Donald Trump has made it clear, once we've done all of those things, that we're going to reform the immigration system that we have..."
592	0	I just have to correct Governor Pence....
593	0	where people can come into this country.
594	0	I have to...
595	0	That's the order that you should do it.
596	0	"Border security, removing criminal aliens, upholding with law, and then -- but then, Senator, I'll work you when you go back to the Senate, I promise you, we'll work you to reform the immigration system."
597	0	I look forward to working together in whatever capacities we serve in.
598	0	"But I just want to make it very, very clear that he's trying to fuzz up what Donald Trump has said."
599	0	"When Donald Trump spoke in Phoenix, he looked the audience in the eye and he said, no, we're building a wall, and we're deporting everybody."
600	0	"He said, quote, ""They will all be gone."""
601	0	They will all be gone.
602	0	And this is one of these ones where you can just go to the tape on it and see what Donald Trump has said.
603	0	And to add...
604	0	He's talking about criminal aliens.
605	0	"And to add to it, and to add to it, and to add to it, we are a nation of immigrants."
606	0	Mike Pence and I both are descended from immigrant families.
607	0	"Some things, you know, maybe weren't said so great about the Irish when they came, but we've done well by absorbing immigrants, and it's made our nation stronger."
608	0	"When Donald Trump says Mexicans are rapists and criminals, Mexican immigrants, when Donald Trump says about your judge, a Hoosier judge, he said that Judge Curiel was unqualified to hear a case because his parents were Mexican, I can't imagine how you could defend that."
609	0	"Gentleman, I'd like to shift now to the threat of terrorism."
610	0	Do you think the world today is a safer or more dangerous place than it was eight years ago?
611	0	Has the terrorist threat increased or decreased?
612	0	Senator Kaine?
613	0	"The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways, because bin Laden is dead."
614	0	The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because an Iranian nuclear weapons program has been stopped.
615	0	"The terrorist threat to United States troops has been decreased in some ways because there's not 175,000 in a dangerous part of the world."
616	0	"There's only 15,000."
617	0	But there are other parts of the world that are challenging.
618	0	"Let me tell you this: To beat terrorism, there's only one candidate who can do it, and it's Hillary Clinton."
619	0	"Remember, Hillary Clinton was the senator from New York on 9/11."
620	0	She was there at the World Trade Center when they were still searching for victims and survivors.
621	0	"That's seared onto her, the need to beat terrorism."
622	0	And she's got a plan to do it.
623	0	She was part of the national security team that wiped out bin Laden.
624	0	Here's her plan to defeat ISIL.
625	0	"First, we've got to keep taking out their leaders on the battlefield."
626	0	"She was part of the team that got bin Laden, and she'll lead the team that will get Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS."
627	0	"Second, we've got to disrupt financing networks, third, disrupt their ability to recruit on the Internet, in their safe havens."
628	0	"But, fourth, we also have to work with allies to share and surge intelligence."
629	0	That's the Hillary Clinton plan; she's got the experience to do it.
630	0	Donald Trump.
631	0	Donald Trump can't start a Twitter war with Miss Universe without shooting himself in the foot.
632	0	Donald Trump doesn't have a plan.
633	0	"He said, I have a secret plan,"" and then he said, Um, I know more than all the generals about ISIL."
634	0	"And then he said, ""I'm going to call the generals to help me figure out a plan."""
635	0	"And finally he said, ""I'm going to fire all the generals."""
636	0	He doesn't have a plan.
637	0	But he does have dangerous ideas.
638	0	Here's four.
639	0	He trash talks the military.
640	0	"The military is a disaster, John McCain's no hero, the generals need all to be fired, and I know more than them."
641	0	He wants to tear up alliances.
642	0	"NATO is obsolete, and we'll only work together with Israel if they pay ""big league."""
643	0	"Third, he loves dictators."
644	0	"He's got kind of a personal Mount Rushmore, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, Moammar Gadhafi..."
645	0	"Oh, please."
646	0	Come on.
647	0	and Saddam Hussein.
648	1	"And last and most dangerously, Donald Trump believes -- Donald Trump believes that the world will be safer if more nations have nuclear weapons."
649	1	"He's said Saudi Arabia should get them, Japan should get them, Korea should get them."
650	1	"And when he was confronted with this, and told, wait a minute, terrorists could get those, proliferation could lead to nuclear war, here's what Donald Trump said, and I quote: ""Go ahead, folks, enjoy yourselves."""
651	0	I'd love to hear Governor Pence tell me what's so enjoyable or comical about nuclear war.
652	0	Governor Pence?
653	0	Did you work on that one a long time?
654	0	Because that had a lot of really creative lines in it.
655	0	"Well, I'm going to see if you can defend any of it."
656	0	"Well, look, I can defend -- I -- I -- I can -- I can make very clear to the American people, after traveling millions of miles as our secretary of state, after being the architect of the foreign policy of this administration, America is less safe today than it was the day that Barack Obama became president of the United States."
657	0	It's absolutely inarguable.
658	0	We've weakened America's place in the world.
659	0	"It's been a combination of factors, but mostly it's been a lack of leadership."
660	0	"I mean, I will give you -- and I was in Washington, D.C., on 9/11."
661	0	I saw the clouds of smoke rise from the Pentagon.
662	0	I was in Virginia where the Pentagon's...
663	0	(CROSSTALK)
664	0	I know you were.
665	0	We all lived through that day as a nation.
666	0	It was heartbreaking.
667	0	And I want to give this president credit for bringing Osama bin Laden to justice.
668	0	"But the truth is, Osama bin Laden led Al Qaida."
669	0	Our primary threat today is ISIS.
670	0	"And because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement that would have allowed some American combat troops to remain in Iraq and secure the hard fought gains the American soldier had won by 2009, ISIS was able to be literally conjured up out of the desert, and it's overrun vast areas that the American soldier had won in Operation Iraqi Freedom."
671	0	My heart breaks for the likes of Lance Cpl.
672	0	Scott Zubowski.
673	0	He fell in Fallujah in 2005.
674	0	"He fought hard through some of the most difficult days in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and he paid the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom and secure that nation."
675	0	And that nation was secured in 2009.
676	0	"But because Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama failed to provide a status of forces agreement and leave sufficient troops in there, we are back at war."
677	0	The president just ordered more troops on the ground.
678	0	We are back at war in Iraq.
679	0	"And Scott Zubowski, whose mom would always come to Memorial Day events in Newcastle, Indiana, to see me, and I'd give her a hug and tell her we're never going to forget her son and we never will, Scott Zubowski and the sacrifices the American soldier made were squandered in Iraq because this administration created a vacuum in which ISIS was able to grow."
680	0	"And a reference to the Iranian deal, the Iranian deal that Hillary Clinton initiated, $150 billion to the radical mullahs in Iran."
681	0	Stopping a nuclear weapons program without firing a shot?
682	0	You didn't stop the nuclear weapons program.
683	0	"Yes, we did."
684	0	You essentially...
685	0	Even the Israeli military says it stopped.
686	0	"guaranteed that Iran will someday become a nuclear power, because there's no limitations once the period of time of the treaty comes off."
687	0	"Governor Pence, Mr. Trump has proposed extreme vetting of immigrants from parts of the world that export terrorism."
688	0	"But that does not address many of the recent terrorist attacks in the United States, such as the Orlando nightclub massacre and the recent bombings in New York and New Jersey."
689	0	"Those were homegrown, committed by U.S. citizens and legal residents."
690	0	What specific tools would you use to prevent those kinds of attacks?
691	0	"Well, I think it's -- I think it's a great question, Elaine, but it really does begin with us reforming our immigration system and putting the interests, particularly the safety and security of the American people, first."
692	0	"I mean, Donald Trump has called for extreme vetting for people coming into this country so that we don't bring people into the United States who are hostile to our Bill of Rights freedoms, who are hostile to the American way life."
693	0	"But also, Donald Trump and I are committed to suspending the Syrian refugee program and programs and immigration from areas of the world that have been compromised by terrorism."
694	0	Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to increase the Syrian refugee program by 500...
695	0	(CROSSTALK)
696	0	"Elaine, I want to..."
697	0	(CROSSTALK)
698	0	"Governor, the question was about homegrown."
699	0	"Yeah, and so -- but first, you know, let's make sure we're putting the safety and security of the American people first instead of Hillary Clinton expanding the Syrian refugee program..."
700	0	Or instead of you violating the Constitution by blocking people based on their national origin rather than whether they're dangerous.
701	0	That's not -- that's absolutely false.
702	0	"That's what the Seventh Circuit decided just -- here's the difference, Elaine."
703	0	The Seventh Circuit...
704	0	We have different views on -- on refugee issues and on immigration.
705	0	"Hillary and I want to do enforcement based on, are people dangerous?"
706	0	These guys say all Mexicans are bad.
707	0	That's absolutely false.
708	0	"And with respect to refugees, we want to keep people out if they're dangerous."
709	0	Donald Trump said keep them out if they're Muslim.
710	0	Mike Pence...
711	0	Absolutely...
712	0	put a program in place to keep them out if they're from Syria.
713	0	And yesterday an appellate court with three Republican judges struck down the Pence plan...
714	0	Right.
715	0	Right.
716	0	and said it was discriminatory...
717	0	And those judges -- those judges said...
718	0	"We should focus upon danger, not upon discrimination."
719	0	Governor?
720	0	"Elaine, to your point, those judges said it was because there wasn't any evidence yet that -- that ISIS had infiltrated the United States."
721	0	"Well, Germany just arrested three Syrian refugees that were connected to ISIS."
722	0	(CROSSTALK)
723	0	But they told you there's a right way and a wrong way to do it.
724	0	"But, look, if you're going to be critical of me on that, that's fair game."
725	0	"I will tell you, after two Syrian refugees were involved in the attack in Paris that is called Paris' 9/11, as governor of the state of Indiana, I have no higher priority than the safety and security of the people of my state."
726	0	"But, Governor Pence..."
727	0	So you bet I suspended that program.
728	0	"But, Governor Pence, I just..."
729	0	And I stand by that decision.
730	0	"And if I'm vice president of the United States or Donald Trump is president, we're going to put the safety and security of the American people first."
731	0	Sure.
732	0	Can we just be clear -- Hillary and I will do immigration enforcement and we'll vet refugees based on whether they're dangerous or not.
733	0	We won't do it based on discriminating against you from the country you come from or the religion that you practice.
734	0	But the problem with that...
735	0	That is completely antithetical to the Jeffersonian values of...
736	0	(CROSSTALK)
737	0	"Elaine, the director of the FBI, our homeland security, said we can't know for certain who these people are coming from Syria."
738	0	"Yes, we can, and when we don't let them know, we don't let them in."
739	0	So -- the FBI...
740	0	"When we don't know who they are, we don't let them in."
741	0	The FBI and homeland security said we can't know for certain.
742	0	"You've got to err on the side of the safety and security of the American people, Senator."
743	0	I understand the...
744	0	By trashing all Syrians or trashing all Muslims?
745	0	the U.N. wants us to expand the Syrian refugee program...
746	0	"Senator Kaine, let me ask you this."
747	0	Secretary Clinton...
748	0	We're going to put the safety and security of the American people first.
749	0	has talked about an intelligence surge.
750	0	Yes.
751	0	What exactly would an intelligence surge look like?
752	0	And how would that help identify terrorists with no operational connection to a foreign terrorist organization?
753	0	"Intelligence surge is two-thirds, Elaine."
754	0	It's two things.
755	0	"It's, first, dramatically expanding our intelligence capacities by hiring great professionals, but also we've got some of the best intel and cyber employees in the world right here in the United States working for many of our private sector companies."
756	0	"So it involves increasing our own workforce, but striking great partnerships with some of our cyber and intel experts in the private sector so that we can, consistent with constitutional principles, gather more intelligence."
757	0	"But the second piece of this is really, really important."
758	0	"It also means creating stronger alliances, because you gather intelligence and then you share your intelligence back and forth with allies."
759	0	"And that's how you find out who may be trying to recruit, who may be trying to come to one country or the next."
760	0	Alliances are critical.
761	1	That's why Donald Trump's claim that he wants to -- that NATO is obsolete and that we need to get rid of NATO is so dangerous.
762	0	That's not his plan.
763	0	"Well, he said NATO is obsolete."
764	0	"And, look, if you put aside -- push aside your alliances, who you're going to share intelligence with?"
765	0	Hillary Clinton is the secretary of state who knows how to build alliances.
766	0	She built the sanctions regime around the word that stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
767	0	And that's what an intelligence surge means.
768	0	"Better skill and capacity, but also better alliances."
769	0	All right.
770	0	I'd like to turn now to the tragedy in Syria.
771	0	Two hundred fifty thousand...
772	0	Can I speak about the cybersecurity surge at all?
773	0	"You can -- you can have 30 seconds, Governor, quickly, please."
774	0	"First, Donald Trump just spoke about this issue this week."
775	0	We have got to bring together the best resources of this country to understand that cyber warfare is the new warfare of the asymmetrical enemies that we face in this country.
776	0	And I look forward if I'm privileged to be in this role of working with you in the Senate to make sure that we resource that effort.
777	0	We will work together in whatever roles we inhabit.
778	0	"We have an intelligence, sir (ph)."
779	0	But I will also tell you that it's important in this moment to remember that Hillary Clinton had a private server in her home that had classified information on it...
780	0	And I don't -- 30 seconds is on up.
781	0	"about drone strikes, e-mails from the president of the United States of America were on there."
782	0	Right.
783	0	Her private server was subject to being hacked by foreign...
784	0	(CROSSTALK)
785	0	"I'd like to ask you about Syria, Governor."
786	0	We could put cybersecurity first if we just make sure the next secretary of state doesn't have a private server.
787	0	(CROSSTALK)
788	1	And all investigation concluded that not one reasonable prosecutor would take any additional step.
789	0	You don't get to decide the rights and wrongs of this.
790	0	We have a justice system that does that.
791	1	And a Republican FBI director did an investigation and concluded that...
792	0	"All right, we are moving on now."
793	0	Two hundred fifty thousand people...
794	0	If your son or my son handled classified information the way Hillary Clinton did...
795	0	one hundred thousand of them children -- Governor...
796	0	they'd be court martialed.
797	0	That is absolutely false and you know that.
798	0	Absolutely true.
799	0	"And you know that, Governor."
800	0	Governor...
801	0	It's absolutely true.
802	0	"Gentlemen, please."
803	0	Because the FBI did an investigation.
804	0	Gentlemen.
805	0	And they concluded that there was no reasonable prosecutor who would take it further.
806	0	Sorry.
807	0	"Senator Kaine, Governor Pence, please."
808	0	Syria.
809	0	I want to turn now to Syria.
810	0	"Two hundred fifty thousand people, 100,000 of them children, are under siege in Aleppo, Syria."
811	0	"Bunker buster bombs, cluster munitions, and incendiary weapons are being dropped on them by Russian and Syrian militaries."
812	0	"Does the U.S. have a responsibility to protect civilians and prevent mass casualties on this scale, Governor Pence?"
813	0	"The United States of America needs to begin to exercise strong leadership to protect the vulnerable citizens and over 100,000 children in Aleppo."
814	0	"Hillary Clinton's top priority when she became secretary of state was the Russian reset, the Russians reset."
815	0	"After the Russian reset, the Russians invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea."
816	0	"And the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America -- the greatest nation on Earth -- just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins -- look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership."
817	0	It begins by rebuilding our military.
818	0	And the Russians and the Chinese have been making enormous investments in the military.
819	0	We have the smallest Navy since 1916.
820	0	We have the lowest number of troops since the end of the Second World War.
821	0	"We've got to work with Congress, and Donald Trump will, to rebuild our military and project American strength in the world."
822	0	"But about Aleppo and about Syria, I truly do believe that what America ought to do right now is immediately establish safe zones, so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas, work with our Arab partners, real time, right now, to make that happen."
823	0	"And secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength."
824	0	"And if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo."
825	0	"There's a broad range of other things that we ought to do, as well."
826	0	We ought to deploy a missile defense shield to the Czech Republic and Poland which Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama pulled back on out of not wanting to offend the Russians back in 2009.
827	0	"Governor, your two minutes are up."
828	0	We've just got to have American strength on the world stage.
829	0	"When Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, the Russians and other countries in the world will know they're dealing with a strong American president."
830	0	Senator Kaine?
831	0	"Hillary and I also agree that the establishment of humanitarian zones in northern Syria with the provision of international human aid, consistent with the U.N. Security Council resolution that was passed in February 2014, would be a very, very good idea."
832	0	And Hillary also has the ability to stand up to Russia in a way that this ticket does not.
833	0	"Donald Trump, again and again, has praised Vladimir Putin."
834	0	And it's clear that he has business dealings with Russian oligarchs who are very connected to Putin.
835	0	The Trump campaign management team had to be fired a month or so ago because of those shadowy connections with pro-Putin forces.
836	0	"Governor Pence made the odd claim, he said inarguably Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama."
837	0	Vladimir Putin has run his economy into the ground.
838	0	He persecutes LGBT folks and journalists.
839	0	"If you don't know the difference between dictatorship and leadership, then you got to go back to a fifth-grade civics class."
840	0	I'll tell you what offends me...
841	0	"Well, that offended me."
842	0	Governor Pence just said -- Governor Pence just said that Donald Trump will rebuild the military.
843	0	"No, he won't."
844	0	Donald Trump is avoiding paying taxes.
845	0	The New York Times story -- and we need to get this -- but the New York Times suggested that he probably didn't pay taxes for about 18 years starting in 1995.
846	0	Those years included the years of 9/11.
847	0	So get this.
848	0	"On 9/11, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's hometown was attacked by the worst terrorist attack in the history of the United States."
849	0	Young men and women -- young men and women signed up to serve in the military to fight terrorism.
850	0	"Hillary Clinton went to Washington to get funds to rebuild her city and protect first responders, but Donald Trump was fighting a very different fight."
851	0	It was a fight to avoid paying taxes so that he wouldn't support the fight against terror.
852	0	"The question was about Aleppo, Senator."
853	0	He wouldn't support troops.
854	0	"He wouldn't -- he wouldn't support -- this is important, Elaine."
855	0	"When a guy running for president will not support the troops, not support veterans, not support teachers, that's really important."
856	0	Right.
857	0	"And I said about Aleppo, we do agree the notion is we have to create a humanitarian zone in northern Syria."
858	0	It's very important.
859	0	"Governor Pence, you had mentioned no-fly zone."
860	0	Where would you propose setting up a safe zone specifically?
861	0	How would you keep it safe?
862	0	"Well, first and foremost, Donald Trump supports our troops."
863	0	Donald Trump supports our veterans.
864	0	He won't pay taxes.
865	0	Donald Trump has paid all the taxes that he's -- do you not take deductions?
866	0	How does that work?
867	0	"Gentlemen, this is about Syria."
868	0	I'd like to...
869	0	(CROSSTALK)
870	0	"Honestly, Senator."
871	0	"Honestly, Senator."
872	0	It is about our troops.
873	0	It is about our troops.
874	0	I understand why you want to change -- I understand why you want to change the subject.
875	0	How can you support the troops if you won't pay taxes?
876	0	I understand why you want to change the subject.
877	0	And let me be very clear on this Russian thing.
878	0	The larger question here...
879	0	Do you think Donald Trump is smart to not pay taxes?
880	0	"Gentlemen, we're going to have time to get to Russia here."
881	0	"What we're dealing with is the -- you know, there's an old proverb that says the Russian bear never dies, it just hibernates."
882	0	"And the truth of the matter is, the weak and feckless foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama has awakened an aggression in Russia that first appeared a few years ago with their move in Georgia, now their move into Crimea, now their move into the wider Middle East."
883	0	"And all the while, all we do is fold our arms and say we're not having talks anymore."
884	0	"To answer your question, we just need American strength."
885	0	"We need to -- we need to marshal the resources of our allies in the region, and in the immediate, we need to act and act now to get people out of harm's way."
886	0	And exactly how would those safe zones work?
887	0	How would they remain safe?
888	0	"The -- the safe zones would have to be -- as the senator said, there's already a framework for this that's been recognized by the international community."
889	0	"The United States of America needs to be prepared to work with our allies in the region to create a route for safe passage and then to protect people in those areas, including with a no-fly zone."
890	0	"But, look, this is very tough stuff."
891	0	I served on the Foreign Affairs Committee for a decade.
892	0	I traveled in and out of that region for 10 years.
893	0	I saw what the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom.
894	0	And to see the weak and feckless leadership that Hillary Clinton was the architect of and the foreign policy of the Obama administration...
895	0	"Well, let me -- let me come back..."
896	0	is deeply troubling to me.
897	0	That will all change the day Donald Trump becomes president of the United States.
898	0	"and talk about -- let me talk about the things that Governor Pence doesn't want to acknowledge, Elaine."
899	0	He doesn't want to acknowledge that we stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
900	0	He doesn't want to acknowledge...
901	0	We didn't.
902	0	that Hillary was part of a team that got bin Laden.
903	0	He doesn't want to acknowledge...
904	0	I just did.
905	0	"that it's a good thing, not a bad thing, that it's a good thing -- not a bad thing -- that we're down from 175,000 troops deployed overseas to 15,000."
906	0	But let me tell you what will really make the Middle East dangerous.
907	0	"Donald Trump's idea that more nations should get nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Korea."
908	0	Ronald Reagan said something really interesting about nuclear proliferation back in the 1980s.
909	0	He said the problem with nuclear proliferation is that some fool or maniac could trigger a catastrophic event.
910	0	"And I think that's who Governor Pence's running mate is, exactly who Governor Reagan warned us about."
911	0	And come on.
912	0	Senator.
913	0	"Senator, that was even beneath you and Hillary Clinton."
914	0	And that -- that's pretty low.
915	0	But do you -- do you think -- do you think we should have -- more nuclear weapons in the world will make us safer?
916	0	"Senator, the..."
917	0	That's what Donald Trump thinks.
918	0	Ronald Reagan also said nuclear war should never be fought because it can never be won.
919	0	And the United States of America needs to make investments in modernizing our nuclear force for both deterrence...
920	0	But can you defend Donald Trump's claim that more nations should get nuclear weapons?
921	0	and assurance to our allies.
922	0	But let me go back to this Iran thing.
923	0	"I mean, he keeps saying that they prevented -- that Hillary Clinton started the deal with the Iranians prevented Iran from getting a nuclear weapon."
924	0	(CROSSTALK)
925	0	That's what the Israeli joint chiefs of staff is saying right now.
926	0	"Well, that's not what -- that's not what Israel thinks."
927	0	"Gadi Eizenkot, you can go check it."
928	0	You wouldn't necessarily know that.
929	0	Go to the tape.
930	0	I know you boycotted Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech when he came before the Congress.
931	0	"No, I visited him in his office."
932	0	I visited him in his office.
933	0	You boycotted the speech.
934	0	"The point is, what this Iran -- so-called Iran deal did was essentially guarantee -- I mean, when I was in Congress, I fought hard on a bipartisan basis with Republican and Democrat members to move forward the toughest sanctions, it -- literally in the history of the United States, against Iran."
935	0	And then Hillary used them to get a deal.
936	0	"We were bringing them to heel, but the goal was always that we would only lift the sanctions if Iran permanently renounced their nuclear ambitions."
937	0	"Elaine, let me just mention one thing."
938	0	(CROSSTALK)
939	0	"They have not -- Elaine, let me finish a sentence."
940	0	They have not renounced their nuclear ambitions.
941	0	"And when the deal's period runs out, there's no limitation on them obtaining weapons."
942	0	That...
943	0	(CROSSTALK)
944	0	"And very quickly, Senator."
945	0	Elaine...
946	0	and the fact that they got $1.7 billion in a ransom payment...
947	0	We need to talk about Russia.
948	0	"Very quickly, though, Senator, please."
949	0	is astonishing to the American people.
950	0	"Six times tonight, I have said to Governor Pence I can't imagine how you can defend your running mate's position on one issue after the next."
951	0	"And in all six cases, he's refused to defend his running mate."
952	0	"Well, let's -- no, no, don't put words in my mouth."
953	0	All right.
954	0	He's going...
955	0	(CROSSTALK)
956	0	And yet he is asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend.
957	0	And I just think that should be underlined.
958	0	"No, I'm -- look..."
959	0	(CROSSTALK)
960	0	"All right, gentlemen, let's talk about Russia."
961	0	This is a topic that has come up.
962	0	"I'm very, very happy to defend Donald Trump."
963	0	"If he wants to take these one at a time, I'll take them one at a time."
964	0	I will give you an opportunity to do that.
965	0	More nations should get nuclear weapons.
966	0	Try to defend that.
967	0	Don't put words in my mouth.
968	0	"Well, he never said that, Senator."
969	0	He absolutely said it.
970	0	"Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan."
971	0	"Most of the stuffy you've said, he's never said."
972	0	"Gentlemen, Russia."
973	0	"Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, and has provided crucial military support to the Assad regime."
974	0	"What steps, if any, would your administration take to counter these actions?"
975	0	Senator Kaine?
976	0	You've got to be tough on Russia.
977	0	So let's start with not praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader.
978	0	Donald Trump and Mike Pence have said he's a great leader.
979	0	And Donald Trump has business...
980	0	"No, we haven't."
981	0	has business dealings -- has business dealings with Russia that he refuses to disclose.
982	0	Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to- toe with Russia.
983	0	She went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START Agreement to reduce Russia's nuclear stockpile.
984	0	She's had the experience doing it.
985	0	She went toe-to-toe with Russia and lodged protests when they went into Georgia.
986	0	"And we've done the same thing about Ukraine, but more than launching protests, we've put punishing economic sanctions on Russia that we need to continue."
987	0	"Donald Trump, on the other hand, didn't know that Russia had invaded the Crimea."
988	0	"Oh, that's nonsense."
989	0	"He was on a TV show a couple months back, and he said, ""I'll guarantee you this, Russia's not going into the Ukraine."""
990	0	And he had to be reminded that they had gone into the Crimea two years before.
991	0	He knew that.
992	0	Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to-toe with Russia to work out a deal on New START.
993	0	She got them engaged on a meaningful way to cap Iran's nuclear weapons program.
994	0	And yet she stood up to them on issues such as Syria and their invasion of Georgia.
995	0	"You've got to have the ability to do that, and Hillary does."
996	0	"On the other hand, in Donald Trump, you have somebody who praises Vladimir Putin all the time."
997	0	"America should really wonder about a President Trump, who had a campaign manager with ties to Putin, pro- Putin elements in the Ukraine, who had to be fired for that reason."
998	0	"They should wonder -- when Donald Trump is sitting down with Vladimir Putin, is it going to be America's bottom line or is it going to be Donald Trump's bottom line that he's going to be worried about with all of his business dealings?"
999	0	"Now, this could be solved if Donald Trump would be willing to release his tax returns, as he told the American public that he would do."
1000	0	"And I know he's laughing at this, but every president..."
1001	0	But what's it got to do with Russia?
1002	0	"Every president since Richard Nixon has done it, and Donald Trump has said I'm doing business with Russia."
1003	0	The only way the American public will see whether he has a conflict of interest...
1004	0	"No, he hasn't said that."
1005	0	"He has, actually."
1006	0	"Senator, your time is up."
1007	0	Governor?
1008	0	"Well, thanks."
1009	0	I'm just trying to keep up with the insult-driven campaign on the other side of the table.
1010	0	"You know, I'm just saying facts about your running mate."
1011	0	Yeah.
1012	0	And I know you can't defend.
1013	0	"Senator, please."
1014	0	This is the governor's two minutes.
1015	0	"I'm happy to defend him, Senator."
1016	0	Don't put words in my mouth that I'm not defending him.
1017	0	You're not.
1018	0	I'm happy to defend him.
1019	0	"Most of what you said is completely false, and the American people know that."
1020	0	I'll run through the list of things where you won't defend...
1021	0	This isn't the old days where you can just say stuff and people believe it.
1022	0	"Senator, please."
1023	0	This is Governor Pence's two minutes.
1024	0	"Look, this is the alternative universe of Washington, D.C., versus reality."
1025	0	Hillary Clinton said her number-one priority was a reset with Russia.
1026	0	"That reset resulted in the invasion of Ukraine, after they'd infiltrated with what are called little green men, Russian soldiers that were dressing up like Ukrainian dissidents, and then they moved all the way into Crimea, took over the Crimean Peninsula."
1027	0	Donald Trump knew that happened.
1028	0	He basically was saying it's not going to happen again.
1029	0	"The truth of the matter is that what you have in the rise of aggressive Russia, which has had -- increased its influence in Iran, that's now -- now because of this deal is on a pathway in the future to obtain a nuclear -- the leading state sponsor of terror in the world in Iran now has a closer working relationship with Russia because of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's foreign policy and $150 billion and sanctions all being lifted."
1030	0	"And then, of course, Syria, I mean, it really is extraordinary that -- Syria is imploding."
1031	0	You just asked a very thoughtful question about the disaster in Aleppo.
1032	0	ISIS is headquartered in Raqqa.
1033	0	"It is -- ISIS from Raqqa has overrun vast areas that at great sacrifice the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and yet Senator Kaine still sits here, loyal soldier -- I get all that -- in saying that the foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama somehow made the world more secure."
1034	0	"I mean, it really is astonishing that on the day..."
1035	0	We even wiped out the leader of Al Qaida.
1036	0	on the day that Iran released four American hostages...
1037	0	We stopped Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
1038	0	Governor...
1039	0	we delivered $400 million in cash as a ransom payment for Americans held by the radical mullahs in Tehran.
1040	0	(CROSSTALK)
1041	0	"Governor, yesterday, Mr. Trump said..."
1042	0	And we stopped a nuclear weapons program without a shot.
1043	0	"quote, ""Putin has no respect for Hillary Clinton and no respect for Obama."""
1044	0	Why do you think he'll respect a Trump- Pence administration?
1045	0	Strength.
1046	0	Plain and simple.
1047	0	Business dealings.
1048	0	Donald Trump -- that's nonsense.
1049	0	Donald Trump is a strong leader...
1050	0	Donald Trump's son says that the Trump organization...
1051	0	who is going to lead with American strength.
1052	0	"Please, Senator, I'll give you a chance to respond."
1053	0	We're going to rebuild our military.
1054	0	And let me -- let me -- this whole Putin thing.
1055	0	"Look, America is stronger than Russia."
1056	0	Our economy is 16 times larger than the Russian economy.
1057	0	"America's political system is superior to the crony, corrupt capitalist system in Russia in every way."
1058	0	"When Donald Trump and I observe that, as I've said in Syria, in Iran, in Ukraine, that the small and bullying leader of Russia has been stronger on the world stage than this administration, that's stating painful facts."
1059	0	That's not an endorsement of Vladimir Putin.
1060	0	That's an indictment of the weak and feckless leadership...
1061	0	Senator Kaine?
1062	0	of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
1063	0	"Well, this is one where we can just kind of go to the tape on it."
1064	1	"But Governor Pence said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama."
1065	0	That is absolutely inaccurate.
1066	0	And -- and -- and I just think a guy who praises...
1067	0	He said he's stronger -- he's been stronger on the world stage.
1068	0	"No, he said leader."
1069	0	"And if -- and I'll just say this, Governor."
1070	0	You just said better.
1071	0	"If you mistake leadership for dictatorship, and you can't tell the difference, a country that's running its economy into the ground..."
1072	0	"Yeah, here we go."
1073	0	This is the grade school thing again?
1074	0	persecuting journalists...
1075	0	"Right, this is grade school."
1076	0	"if you can't tell the difference, you shouldn't be commander-in-chief."
1077	0	Yeah.
1078	0	And with Donald Trump -- Donald Trump's sons say that they have all these business dealings with Russia.
1079	0	"Those could be disclosed with tax returns, but they refuse to do them."
1080	0	Americans need to worry about whether Donald Trump will be watching out for America's bottom line or his own bottom line.
1081	0	"Senator Kaine, what went wrong with the Russia reset?"
1082	0	Vladimir Putin.
1083	0	Vladimir Putin is a dictator.
1084	0	And what would do you differently?
1085	0	Vladimir Putin is a dictator.
1086	0	He's not a leader.
1087	0	Anybody who thinks otherwise doesn't know Russian history and they don't know Vladimir Putin.
1088	0	Hillary Clinton knows exactly who this guy is.
1089	0	"John McCain said, I look in his eyes and I see KGB."
1090	0	And Hillary kind of has that same feeling.
1091	0	Right.
1092	0	So how do deal with him?
1093	0	You've got to -- we do have to deal with Russia in a lot of different ways.
1094	0	There are areas where we can cooperate.
1095	0	So it was Hillary Clinton who worked with Russia on the New START Treaty to reduce their nuclear weapons stockpile.
1096	0	It was Hillary Clinton that worked with Russia to get them engaged in a community of nations to stop the Iranian nuclear weapons without firing a shot.
1097	0	She's not going around praising Vladimir Putin as a great guy.
1098	0	But she knows how to sit down at a table and negotiate tough deals.
1099	0	"This is a very challenging part of the world, and we ought to have a commander-in-chief who is prepared and done it, rather than somebody who goes around praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader."
1100	0	"All right, I'd like to ask now about North Korea, Iran and the threat of nuclear weapons."
1101	0	North Korea recently conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test.
1102	0	Right.
1103	0	What specific steps would you take to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States?
1104	0	Governor Pence?
1105	0	"Well, first, we need to -- we need to make a commitment to rebuild our military, including modernizing our nuclear forces."
1106	0	"And we also need -- we also need an effective American diplomacy that will marshal the resources of nations in the Asian Pacific Rim to put pressure on North Korea, on Kim Jong-un, to abandon his nuclear ambitions."
1107	0	"It has to remain the policy of the United States of America the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, plain and simple."
1108	0	"And when Donald Trump is president of the United States, we're -- we're not going to have the -- the kind of posture in the world that has Russia invading Crimea and Ukraine, that has the Chinese building new islands in the South China Sea, that has literally the world, including North Korea, flouting American power."
1109	0	We're going to -- we're going to go back to the days of peace through strength.
1110	0	"But I have to tell you that -- that all this talk about tax returns -- and I get it, you know, you want to keep bringing that up."
1111	0	It must have -- must have...
1112	0	Until he...
1113	0	(CROSSTALK)
1114	0	done well in some focus group.
1115	0	But here -- Hillary Clinton and her husband set up a private foundation called the Clinton Foundation.
1116	0	"While she was secretary of state, the Clinton Foundation accepted tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments and foreign donors."
1117	0	"Now, you all need to know out there, this is basic stuff."
1118	0	"Foreign donors, and certainly foreign governments, cannot participate in the American political process."
1119	0	They cannot make financial contributions.
1120	0	But the Clintons figured out a way to create a foundation where foreign governments and foreign donors could donate millions of dollars.
1121	0	"And then we found, thanks to the good work of the Associated Press, that more than half her private meetings when she was secretary of state were given to major donors of the Clinton Foundation."
1122	0	"When you talk about all these -- all these baseless rumors about Russia and the rest, Hillary Clinton -- you asked the trustworthy question at the very beginning -- the reason..."
1123	0	"Governor, your two minutes are up."
1124	0	the reason the American people don't trust Hillary Clinton is because they are looking at the pay to play politics that she operated with the Clinton Foundation through a private server...
1125	0	"Governor, please."
1126	0	while she's secretary of state.
1127	0	"Your two minutes are up, Governor."
1128	0	And they're saying enough is enough.
1129	0	Senator Kaine?
1130	0	"I'm going to talk about the foundation, and then I'll talk about North Korea."
1131	0	"So, on the foundation."
1132	0	I am glad to talk about the foundation.
1133	0	The Clinton Foundation is one of the highest- rated charities in the world.
1134	0	It provides AIDS drugs to about 11.5 million people.
1135	0	It helps Americans deal with opioid overdoses.
1136	0	It gets higher rankings for its charity than the American Red Cross does.
1137	0	The Clinton foundation does an awful lot of good work.
1138	0	Hillary Clinton as secretary of state took no action to benefit the foundation.
1139	0	"The State Department did an investigation, and they concluded that everything Hillary Clinton did as secretary of state was completely in the interest of the United States."
1140	0	So the foundation does good work.
1141	0	And Hillary Clinton as secretary of state acted in the interests of the United States.
1142	0	But let's compare this now with the Trump organization and the Trump Foundation.
1143	0	The Trump organization is an octopus-like organization with tentacles all over the world whose conflict of interests could only be known if Donald Trump would release his tax returns.
1144	0	He's refused to do it.
1145	0	His sons have said that the organization has a lot of business dealings in Russia.
1146	0	"And remember, the Trump organization is not a non-profit."
1147	0	"It's putting money into Donald Trump's pockets and into the pockets of his children, whereas the Clinton Foundation is a non- profit and no Clinton family member draws any salary."
1148	0	The Trump Foundation is non-profit.
1149	0	"In addition, Donald Trump has a foundation."
1150	0	The foundation was just fined for illegally contributing foundation dollars to a political campaign of a Florida attorney general.
1151	0	"They made an illegal contribution, and then they tried to hide it by disguising it to somebody else."
1152	0	And the person they donated to was somebody whose office was charged with investigating Trump University.
1153	0	This is the difference between a foundation that does good work and a secretary of state who acted in accordance with American interest and somebody who is conflicted and doing work around the world and won't share with the American public what he's doing and what those conflicts are.
1154	0	"Governor, I will give you 30 seconds to respond, because I know you want to, but, again, I would remind you both this was about North Korea."
1155	0	(LAUGHTER)
1156	0	"Well, Thank you."
1157	0	Thank you.
1158	0	The Trump Foundation is a private family foundation.
1159	0	They give virtually every cent in the Trump Foundation to charitable causes.
1160	0	Political contributions?
1161	0	Less than ten cents on the dollar in the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.
1162	0	"A $20,000 portrait of Donald Trump?"
1163	1	Less than 10 cents on the dollar of the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.
1164	0	Ninety percent.
1165	0	"It has been a platform for the Clintons to travel the world, to have staff."
1166	1	"But honestly, Senator, we would know a lot more about it if Hillary Clinton would just turn over the 33,000 e-mails..."
1167	0	"All right, let's turn back to North Korea..."
1168	0	that she refused to turn over in her private server...
1169	0	Senator Kaine...
1170	0	and we'd have a much better picture of what the Clinton Foundation was about.
1171	0	"Senator Kaine, if you had intelligence that North Korea was about to launch a missile, a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States, would you take preemptive action?"
1172	0	"If we -- look, a president should take action to defend the United States against imminent threat."
1173	0	You have to.
1174	0	A president has to do that.
1175	0	"Now exactly what action, you would have to determine what your intelligence was, how certain you were of that intelligence, but you would have to take action."
1176	0	You asked the question about how do we deal with a North Korea.
1177	0	I'm on the Foreign Relations Committee.
1178	0	We just did an extensive sanctions package against North Korea.
1179	0	"And interestingly enough, Elaine, the U.N. followed and did this -- virtually the same package."
1180	0	Often China will use their veto in the Security Council to veto a package like that.
1181	0	"They're starting to get worried about North Korea, too."
1182	0	"So they actually supported the sanctions package, even though many of the sanctions are against Chinese firms, Chinese financial institutions."
1183	0	"So we're working together with China, and we need to."
1184	0	"China's another one of those relationships where it's competitive, it's also challenging, and in times like North Korea, we have to be able to cooperate."
1185	0	Hillary understands that very well.
1186	0	"She went once famously to China and stood up at a human rights meeting and looked them in the eye and said, ""Women's rights are human rights."""
1187	0	"They didn't want her to say that, but she did."
1188	0	But she's also worked on a lot of diplomatic and important diplomatic deals with China.
1189	0	And that's what it's going to take.
1190	0	"The thing I would worry a little bit about is that Donald Trump owes about $650 million to banks, including the Bank of China."
1191	0	I'm not sure he could stand up so tough to the people who have loaned him money.
1192	0	All right.
1193	0	I'd like to turn to our next segment now.
1194	0	"And in this, I'd like to focus on social issues."
1195	0	You have both been open about the role that faith has played in your lives.
1196	0	Can you discuss in detail a time when you struggled to balance your personal faith and a public policy position?
1197	0	Senator Kaine?
1198	0	"Yeah, that's an easy one for me, Elaine."
1199	0	It's an easy one.
1200	0	I'm really fortunate.
1201	0	I grew up in a wonderful household with great Irish Catholic parents.
1202	0	My mom and dad are sitting right here.
1203	0	I was educated by Jesuits at Rockhurst High School in Kansas City.
1204	0	My 40th reunion is in 10 days.
1205	0	"And I worked with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, now nearly 35 years ago, and they were the heroes of my life."
1206	0	I try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life.
1207	0	"But I don't believe in this nation, a First Amendment nation, where we don't raise any religion over the other, and we allow people to worship as they please, that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone."
1208	0	"For me, the hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty and so am I."
1209	0	"But I was governor of a state, and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous."
1210	0	And so I had to grapple with that.
1211	0	"When I was running for governor, I was attacked pretty strongly because of my position on the death penalty."
1212	0	"But I looked the voters of Virginia in the eye and said, look, this is my religion."
1213	0	"I'm not going to change my religious practice to get one vote, but I know how to take an oath and uphold the law."
1214	0	"And if you elect me, I will uphold the law."
1215	0	"And I was elected, and I did."
1216	0	"It was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward, but in circumstances where I didn't feel like there was a case for clemency, I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law, and I did."
1217	0	That was a real struggle.
1218	0	"But I think it is really, really important that those of us who have deep faith lives don't feel that we could just substitute our own views for everybody else in society, regardless of their views."
1219	0	Governor Pence?
1220	0	"Well, it's a wonderful question."
1221	0	And my Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am.
1222	0	I was also raised in a wonderful family of faith.
1223	0	It was a church on Sunday morning and grace before dinner.
1224	0	But my Christian faith became real for me when I made a personal decision for Christ when I was a freshman in college.
1225	0	And I've tried to live that out however imperfectly every day of my life since.
1226	0	"And with my wife at my side, we've followed a calling into public service, where we've -- we've tried to -- we've tried to keep faith with the values that we cherish."
1227	0	"And with regard to when I struggle, I appreciate, and -- and -- and -- I have a great deal of respect for Senator Kaine's sincere faith."
1228	0	I truly do.
1229	0	That's shared.
1230	0	"But for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that -- that ancient principle that -- where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life."
1231	0	"The state of Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women, non-abortion alternatives."
1232	0	I'm also very pleased at the fact we're well on our way in Indiana to becoming the most pro-adoption state in America.
1233	0	"I think if you're going to be pro-life, you should -- you should be pro- adoption."
1234	1	But what I can't understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion.
1235	0	"I mean, to hold to the view -- and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life views personally -- but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me."
1236	0	And I cannot -- I can't conscience about -- about a party that supports that.
1237	0	Or that -- I know you've historically opposed taxpayer funding of abortion.
1238	0	But Hillary Clinton wants to -- wants to repeal the longstanding provision in the law where we said we wouldn't use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion.
1239	0	"So for me, my faith informs my life."
1240	0	I try and spend a little time on my knees every day.
1241	0	"But it all for me begins with cherishing the dignity, the worth, the value of every human life."
1242	0	"Elaine, this is a fundamental question, a fundamental question."
1243	0	"Hillary and I are both people out of religious backgrounds, from Methodist church experience, which was really formative for her as a public servant."
1244	0	But we really feel like you should live fully and with enthusiasm the commands of your faith.
1245	0	But it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else.
1246	0	So let's talk about abortion and choice.
1247	0	Let's talk about them.
1248	0	We support Roe v. Wade.
1249	0	"We support the constitutional right of American women to consult their own conscience, their own supportive partner, their own minister, but then make their own decision about pregnancy."
1250	0	That's something we trust American women to do that.
1251	0	"And we don't think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion."
1252	0	Governor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade.
1253	0	He said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history.
1254	0	And we have some young people in the audience who weren't even born when Roe was decided.
1255	0	This is pretty important.
1256	0	"Before Roe v. Wade, states could pass criminal laws to do just that, to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy."
1257	0	I think you should live your moral values.
1258	0	"But the last thing, the very last thing that government should do is have laws that would punish women who make reproductive choices."
1259	0	And that is the fundamental difference between a Clinton-Kaine ticket and a Trump- Pence ticket that wants to punish women who make that choice.
1260	0	"No, it's really not."
1261	0	Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women who made the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy.
1262	0	Then why did Donald Trump say that?
1263	0	We just never would.
1264	0	Why did he say that?
1265	0	"Well, look, it's -- look, he's not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton."
1266	0	And so...
1267	0	"Well, I would admit that's not a polished..."
1268	0	(CROSSTALK)
1269	0	"You know, things don't always come out exactly the way he means them."
1270	0	"Well, can I say..."
1271	0	But I'm telling you what the policy of our administration would be.
1272	0	Great line from the -- great line from the gospel of Matthew.
1273	0	"From the fullness of the heart, the mouth speaks."
1274	0	Yeah.
1275	0	When Donald Trump says women should be punished or Mexicans are rapists and criminals...
1276	0	I'm telling you...
1277	0	"or John McCain is not a hero, he is showing you who he is."
1278	0	"Senator, you've whipped out that Mexican thing again."
1279	0	He -- look...
1280	0	Can you defend it?
1281	0	"There are criminal aliens in this country, Tim, who have come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking American lives."
1282	0	You want to -- you want to use a big broad brush against Mexicans on that?
1283	0	He also said and many of them are good people.
1284	0	You keep leaving that out of your quote.
1285	0	"And if you want me to go there, I'll go there."
1286	0	"But here's -- there is a choice, and it is a choice on life."
1287	0	"I couldn't be more proud to be standing with Donald Trump, who's standing for the right to life."
1288	0	"It's a principle that -- Senator Kaine -- and I'm very gentle about this, because I really do respect you -- it's a principle that you embrace."
1289	0	"And I have appreciated the fact that you've supported the Hyde amendment, which bans the use of taxpayer funding for abortion, in the past, but that's not Hillary Clinton's view."
1290	0	"People need to understand, we can come together as a nation."
1291	0	We can create a culture of life.
1292	0	More and more young people today are embracing life because we know we are -- we're better for it.
1293	0	We can -- like Mother Teresa said at that famous national prayer breakfast...
1294	0	This is important --
1295	0	bring the -- let's welcome the children into our world.
1296	0	There are so many families around the country who can't have children.
1297	0	We could improve adoption...
1298	0	"But, Governor..."
1299	0	so that families that can't have children can adopt more readily those children from crisis pregnancies.
1300	0	"Governor, why don't you trust women to make this choice for themselves?"
1301	0	We can encourage people to support life.
1302	0	Of course we can.
1303	0	But why don't you trust women?
1304	0	Why doesn't Donald Trump trust women to make this choice for themselves?
1305	0	That's what we ought to be doing in public life.
1306	0	"Living our lives of faith or motivation with enthusiasm and excitement, convincing other, dialoguing with each other about important moral issues of the day..."
1307	0	Because there are...
1308	0	"but on fundamental issues of morality, we should let women make their own decisions."
1309	0	"Because there is -- a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable, the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn."
1310	0	I believe it with all my heart.
1311	0	And I couldn't be more proud to be standing with a pro-life candidate in Donald Trump.
1312	0	I do have one final question for you both tonight.
1313	0	It has been a divisive campaign.
1314	0	"Senator Kaine, if your ticket wins, what specifically are you going to do to unify the country and reassure the people who voted against you?"
1315	0	That's a really important one.
1316	0	"That may be the $64,000 question, because it has been a divisive campaign."
1317	0	"And again, Hillary is running a campaign about stronger together, and Donald Trump -- and this is -- this is not directed at this man, except to the extent that he can't defend Donald Trump -- Donald Trump has run a campaign that's been about one insult after the next."
1318	0	But we do have to bring the country together.
1319	0	So here's what we'll do.
1320	0	"Hillary Clinton was first lady, then senator for eight years and secretary of state."
1321	0	And I served in the Senate.
1322	0	"And I'm really amazed, Elaine, as I talk to Republican senators, how well they regard and respect Hillary Clinton."
1323	0	She was on the Armed Services Committee.
1324	0	She was on other committees.
1325	0	"She worked across the aisle when she was first lady to get the CHIP program passed so that 8 million low-income kids have health insurance in this country, including 150,000 in Indiana."
1326	0	She worked across the aisle after 9/11 to get health benefits for the first responders who bravely went into the towers and into the Pentagon.
1327	0	"She worked to get benefits for -- TRICARE benefits for National Guard members, including Hoosiers and Virginians in the National Guard."
1328	0	She has a track record of working across the aisle to make things happen.
1329	0	"And, you know, Elaine, I have the same track record."
1330	0	I was a governor of Virginia with two Republican houses.
1331	0	"And in the Senate, I have good working relationships across the aisle."
1332	0	"Because I think it's fine to be a Democrat or Republican or independent, but after Election Day, the goal is work together."
1333	0	And Hillary Clinton has a track record of accomplishment across the aisle that will enable her to do just that when we work with the new Congress in January.
1334	0	"Governor, how will you unify the country if you win?"
1335	0	"Well, thank you, Elaine, and thanks for a great discussion..."
1336	0	Absolutely.
1337	0	tonight.
1338	0	"Thank you, Senator."
1339	0	This is a very challenging time in the life of our nation.
1340	0	"Weakened America's place in the world after the leadership of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on the world stage has been followed by an economy that is truly struggling, stifled by an avalanche of more taxes, more regulation, Obamacare, the war on coal, and the kind of trade deals that have put American workers in the back seat."
1341	0	"I think the best way that we can bring people together is through change in Washington, D.C."
1342	0	"You know, I served in Washington, D.C., for 12 years in the Congress of the United States."
1343	0	"And I served with many Republicans and Democrats, men and women of goodwill."
1344	0	"The potential is there to really change the direction of this country, but it's going to take leadership to do it."
1345	0	The American people want to see our nation standing tall on the world stage again.
1346	0	"They want to see us supporting our military, rebuilding our military, commanding the respect of the world, and they want to see the American economy off to the races again."
1347	0	They want to see an American comeback.
1348	0	And Donald Trump's entire career has been about building.
1349	0	"It's been about -- it's going through hardship just like a businessperson does and finding a way through smarts and ingenuity and resilience to fight forward and -- when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, we're going to have a stronger America."
1350	0	"When you hear him say he wants to make America great again, when we do that, I truly do believe the American people are going to be standing taller."
1351	0	They're going to see that real change can happen after decades of just talking about it.
1352	0	"And when that happens, the American people are going to stand tall, stand together, and we'll have the kind of unity that's been missing for way too long."
1353	0	"All right, gentlemen, thank you so much."
1354	0	This concludes the vice presidential debate.
1355	0	"My thanks to the candidates, the commission, and to you for watching."
1356	0	"Please tune in this Sunday for the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis and the final debate on October 19th at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas."
1357	0	"From Farmville, Virginia, I'm Elaine Quijano of CBS News."
1358	0	Good night.
1	0	"Ladies and gentlemen the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, and the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton."
2	0	(APPLAUSE)
3	0	Thank you very much for being here.
4	0	We're going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall.
5	0	Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question.
6	0	"Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so you'll go first."
7	0	Our first question comes from Patrice Brock.
8	0	Patrice?
9	0	"Thank you, and good evening."
10	0	"The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines."
11	0	"Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students' homework, do you feel you're modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today's youth?"
12	0	"Well, thank you."
13	0	Are you a teacher?
14	0	"Yes, I think that that's a very good question, because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign."
15	0	And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we're good.
16	0	"And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up."
17	0	"We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country."
18	0	I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together.
19	0	"That's why the slogan of my campaign is ""Stronger Together,"" because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else."
20	0	"If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there's nothing in my opinion that America can't do."
21	0	So that's why I hope that we will come together in this campaign.
22	0	"Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American."
23	0	"I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion."
24	0	"I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that's, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve."
25	0	"Secretary Clinton, thank you."
26	0	"Mr. Trump, you have two minutes."
27	0	"Well, I actually agree with that."
28	0	I agree with everything she said.
29	0	I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country.
30	0	This is a great country.
31	0	This is a great land.
32	0	I've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I've been doing this as a politician.
33	0	"I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician."
34	0	And my whole concept was to make America great again.
35	1	"When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago."
36	0	"When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it's in business and trade, where we're doing so badly."
37	1	"Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit."
38	0	"In other words, trading with other countries."
39	1	We had an $800 billion deficit.
40	0	It's hard to believe.
41	0	Inconceivable.
42	0	You say who's making these deals?
43	0	We're going the make great deals.
44	0	We're going to have a strong border.
45	0	We're going to bring back law and order.
46	0	"Just today, policemen was shot, two killed."
47	0	And this is happening on a weekly basis.
48	0	We have to bring back respect to law enforcement.
49	0	"At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides."
50	0	We need justice.
51	0	"But I want to do things that haven't been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it."
52	0	It's called make America great again.
53	0	"Thank you, Mr. Trump."
54	0	The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today's youth?
55	0	"We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine."
56	0	You called what you said locker room banter.
57	0	"You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals."
58	0	That is sexual assault.
59	0	You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women.
60	0	Do you understand that?
61	0	"No, I didn't say that at all."
62	0	I don't think you understood what was -- this was locker room talk.
63	0	I'm not proud of it.
64	0	I apologize to my family.
65	0	I apologize to the American people.
66	0	Certainly I'm not proud of it.
67	0	But this is locker room talk.
68	0	"You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have -- and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times."
69	0	"We haven't seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world."
70	0	And they look and they see.
71	0	"Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS?"
72	0	And they look at our country and they see what's going on.
73	0	"Yes, I'm very embarrassed by it."
74	0	I hate it.
75	0	"But it's locker room talk, and it's one of those things."
76	0	I will knock the hell out of ISIS.
77	0	We're going to defeat ISIS.
78	0	ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment.
79	0	"And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS."
80	0	"So, Mr. Trump..."
81	0	And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.
82	0	"Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?"
83	0	I have great respect for women.
84	0	Nobody has more respect for women than I do.
85	0	"So, for the record, you're saying you never did that?"
86	0	"I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said."
87	0	And I was embarrassed by it.
88	0	But I have tremendous respect for women.
89	0	Have you ever done those things?
90	0	And women have respect for me.
91	0	"And I will tell you: No, I have not."
92	0	And I will tell you that I'm going to make our country safe.
93	0	"We're going to have borders in our country, which we don't have now."
94	0	"People are pouring into our country, and they're coming in from the Middle East and other places."
95	0	We're going to make America safe again.
96	0	"We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again."
97	0	"And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just -- it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation."
98	0	"Thank you, Mr. Trump."
99	0	"Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they're taking our wealth."
100	0	"Thank you, Mr. Trump."
101	0	And that's what I want to talk about.
102	0	"Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?"
103	0	"Well, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw."
104	0	"You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve."
105	0	Donald Trump is different.
106	0	I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief.
107	0	And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing.
108	0	"What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women."
109	0	And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.
110	0	But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.
111	0	Because we've seen this throughout the campaign.
112	0	We have seen him insult women.
113	0	"We've seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten."
114	0	We've seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter.
115	0	"We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms."
116	0	"So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is."
117	0	"But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others."
118	0	So this is who Donald Trump is.
119	0	"And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are."
120	0	"That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity."
121	0	"These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love."
122	0	And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president.
123	0	And we want to get to some questions from online...
124	0	Am I allowed to respond to that?
125	0	I assume I am.
126	0	"Yes, you can respond to that."
127	0	"It's just words, folks."
128	0	It's just words.
129	0	"Those words, I've been hearing them for many years."
130	0	"I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed."
131	0	"I've heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible."
132	0	I'm going to help the African-Americans.
133	0	"I'm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics."
134	0	I am going to help the inner cities.
135	0	She's done a terrible job for the African-Americans.
136	0	"She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later."
137	0	We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator.
138	0	She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign...
139	0	"Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump -- I want to get to audience questions and online questions."
140	0	"So, she's allowed to do that, but I'm not allowed to respond?"
141	0	You're going to have -- you're going to get to respond right now.
142	0	Sounds fair.
143	0	This tape is generating intense interest.
144	0	"In just 48 hours, it's become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network."
145	0	"As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic."
146	0	"Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, ""Trump says the campaign has changed him."
147	0	"When did that happen?"""
148	0	"So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that."
149	0	"When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently?"
150	0	And you have two minutes for this.
151	0	"It was locker room talk, as I told you."
152	0	That was locker room talk.
153	0	I'm not proud of it.
154	0	"I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country."
155	0	"And certainly, I'm not proud of it."
156	0	But that was something that happened.
157	0	"If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse."
158	0	"Mine are words, and his was action."
159	0	His was what he's done to women.
160	0	There's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
161	1	"So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women."
162	0	Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.
163	0	Four of them here tonight.
164	1	"One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12."
165	1	"Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped."
166	0	"Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight."
167	0	So don't tell me about words.
168	0	I am absolutely -- I apologize for those words.
169	0	But it is things that people say.
170	0	"But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law."
171	0	"He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women."
172	0	"Paula Jones, who's also here tonight."
173	0	"And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth."
174	0	(APPLAUSE)
175	0	Can we please hold the applause?
176	0	"Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes."
177	0	"Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses."
178	0	He gets to decide what he wants to talk about.
179	0	"Instead of answering people's questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that's his choice."
180	0	"When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high."
181	0	(APPLAUSE)
182	0	"And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women."
183	0	But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.
184	0	"He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq."
185	0	And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.
186	0	"He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn't be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, ""Mexican."""
187	0	He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching.
188	0	And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America.
189	0	"He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words."
190	1	"Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal -- he's another real winner that you have -- and he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that."
191	0	So you really owe him an apology.
192	0	"You're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb."
193	0	"That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology."
194	0	"Number two, Michelle Obama."
195	0	I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you.
196	0	"And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary."
197	0	"So, you talk about friend?"
198	0	"Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion."
199	0	"And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance."
200	0	And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.
201	0	"But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing."
202	0	And I'll tell you what.
203	0	"I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it."
204	0	"But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception."
205	0	"There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor."
206	0	"When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious."
207	0	"In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious."
208	1	"There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process."
209	0	"So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you know what?"
210	0	People have been -- their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done.
211	0	And it's a disgrace.
212	0	"And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself."
213	0	"Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that."
214	0	(CROSSTALK)
215	0	I'm going to let you talk about e-mails.
216	0	"because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I'm not surprised."
217	0	"Oh, really?"
218	0	In the first debate...
219	0	(LAUGHTER)
220	0	"And really, the audience needs to calm down here."
221	0	I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time.
222	0	I'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we're going to really make lives better for people.
223	0	"So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com."
224	0	We have literally Trump -- you can fact check him in real time.
225	0	"Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we'll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is -- it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country."
226	0	Because you'd be in jail.
227	0	(APPLAUSE)
228	0	Secretary Clinton...
229	0	We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud.
230	0	Please do not applaud.
231	0	You're just wasting time.
232	0	"And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails."
233	0	You've said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake.
234	0	"You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, ""extremely careless."""
235	0	"The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails."
236	0	You don't call that extremely careless?
237	0	"Well, Martha, first, let me say -- and I've said before, but I'll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it -- that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account."
238	0	"Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not."
239	0	I'm not making any excuses.
240	0	It was a mistake.
241	0	And I am very sorry about that.
242	0	But I think it's also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others.
243	1	"After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all -- anyone who says otherwise has no basis -- that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands."
244	0	I take classified materials very seriously and always have.
245	0	"When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material."
246	0	"Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden."
247	0	So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously.
248	0	"And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands."
249	0	"OK, we're going to move on."
250	0	And yet she didn't know the word -- the letter C on a document.
251	0	Right?
252	0	She didn't even know what that word -- what that letter meant.
253	0	"You know, it's amazing."
254	0	I'm watching Hillary go over facts.
255	0	"And she's going after fact after fact, and she's lying again, because she said she -- you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine."
256	0	"You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails?"
257	0	I don't think so.
258	0	"She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class."
259	0	"Well, maybe we'll give three or three or four or five or something."
260	0	"33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong."
261	0	"And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena."
262	0	That wasn't before.
263	0	That was after.
264	0	She got it from the United States Congress.
265	0	"And I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen."
266	0	"Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case."
267	0	"But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself."
268	0	What you did -- and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.
269	0	We have to move on.
270	0	You did that.
271	0	Wait a minute.
272	0	One second.
273	0	"Secretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we got to move on."
274	0	We want to give the audience a chance.
275	0	"If you did that in the private sector, you'd be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress."
276	0	"Secretary Clinton, you can respond."
277	0	Then we have to move on to an audience question.
278	0	"Look, it's just not true."
279	0	"And so please, go to..."
280	0	"Oh, you didn't delete them?"
281	0	"Allow her to respond, please."
282	0	"It was personal e-mails, not official."
283	0	"Oh, 33,000?"
284	0	Yeah.
285	0	"Not -- well, we turned over 35,000, so..."
286	0	"Oh, yeah."
287	0	"What about the other 15,000?"
288	0	Please allow her to respond.
289	0	She didn't talk while you talked.
290	0	"Yes, that's true, I didn't."
291	0	Because you have nothing to say.
292	0	"I didn't in the first debate, and I'm going to try not to in this debate, because I'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about."
293	0	Get off this question.
294	0	"OK, Donald."
295	0	"I know you're into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it's exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you."
296	0	But let's at least focus...
297	0	Let's see what happens...
298	0	(CROSSTALK)
299	0	Allow her to respond.
300	0	on some of the issues that people care about tonight.
301	0	Let's get to their questions.
302	0	We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz.
303	0	He has a question about health care.
304	0	Ken?
305	0	"I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails?"
306	0	I'd like to know.
307	0	Why aren't you bringing...
308	0	We brought up the e-mails.
309	0	"No, it hasn't."
310	0	It hasn't.
311	0	And it hasn't been finished at all.
312	0	Ken Karpowicz has a question.
313	0	It's nice to -- one on three.
314	0	Thank you.
315	0	"Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable."
316	0	Premiums have gone up.
317	0	Deductibles have gone up.
318	0	Copays have gone up.
319	0	Prescriptions have gone up.
320	0	And the coverage has gone down.
321	0	What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?
322	0	"That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience."
323	0	"If he wants to start, he can start."
324	0	"No, go ahead, Donald."
325	0	"No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary."
326	0	Go ahead.
327	0	(LAUGHTER)
328	0	Secretary Clinton?
329	0	"Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act."
330	0	"And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you."
331	0	Premiums have gotten too high.
332	0	"Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I've laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down."
333	0	"But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before."
334	0	But that in and of itself was a good thing.
335	0	"I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families."
336	0	"But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits."
337	0	"Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition."
338	0	"Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems."
339	0	"Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act."
340	1	"Number four, if you're under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn't happen before."
341	0	So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.
342	0	But we've got to get costs down.
343	0	We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance.
344	0	"But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange."
345	0	And then we would have to start all over again.
346	0	"Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage."
347	0	That's the highest we've ever been in our country.
348	0	"Secretary Clinton, your time is up."
349	0	"So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up."
350	0	"Mr. Trump, you have two minutes."
351	0	"It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense."
352	0	Obamacare is a disaster.
353	0	You know it.
354	0	We all know it.
355	0	It's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide.
356	0	Nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care.
357	0	It's only getting worse.
358	0	"In '17, it implodes by itself."
359	0	"Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money."
360	0	We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.
361	0	Obamacare will never work.
362	0	"It's very bad, very bad health insurance."
363	0	Far too expensive.
364	0	"And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country."
365	0	It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.
366	0	"We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored."
367	0	"We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies."
368	0	We want competition.
369	0	You will have the finest health care plan there is.
370	1	"She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada."
371	0	"And if you haven't noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow."
372	0	It's catastrophic in certain ways.
373	0	"But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything."
374	0	Hillary Clinton has been after this for years.
375	0	Obamacare was the first step.
376	0	Obamacare is a total disaster.
377	0	"And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it."
378	0	"Mr. Trump, your time..."
379	0	"It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced."
380	0	"Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you."
381	0	"Your husband called Obamacare, quote, ""the craziest thing in the world,"" saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half."
382	0	Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth?
383	0	"No, I mean, he clarified what he meant."
384	0	And it's very clear.
385	0	"Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system."
386	0	But we have an employer-based system.
387	0	That's where the vast majority of people get their health care.
388	0	"And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn't put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid."
389	0	"Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them."
390	0	That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take.
391	0	"And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance."
392	0	"So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald's not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies..."
393	0	Secretary Clinton...
394	0	"get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I'm sorry, you've got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma..."
395	0	Your time is up.
396	0	you may not be able to have insurance because you can't afford it.
397	0	"So let's fix what's broken about it, but let's not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies."
398	0	That's not going to work.
399	0	"Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this."
400	0	"Well, I just want -- just one thing."
401	0	"First of all, Hillary, everything's broken about it."
402	0	Everything.
403	0	"Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment."
404	0	"This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster."
405	0	You've said you want to end Obamacare...
406	0	By the way...
407	0	You've said you want to end Obamacare.
408	0	You've also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions.
409	0	How do you force insurance companies to do that if you're no longer mandating that every American get insurance?
410	0	We're going to be able to.
411	0	You're going to have plans...
412	0	What does that mean?
413	0	"Well, I'll tell you what it means."
414	0	"You're going to have plans that are so good, because we're going to have so much competition in the insurance industry."
415	0	Once we break out -- once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come...
416	0	Are you going -- are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?
417	0	"President Obama -- Anderson, excuse me."
418	0	"President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud."
419	0	"You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said -- he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie."
420	0	"President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan."
421	0	"The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn't work."
422	0	"But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we'll also be able to help people that can't get -- don't have money because we are going to have people protected."
423	0	"And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way."
424	0	We're going to block grant into the states.
425	0	We're going to block grant into Medicaid into the states...
426	0	"Thank you, Mr. Trump."
427	0	so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.
428	0	"Thank you, Mr. Trump."
429	0	We now go to Gorbah Hamed with a question for both candidates.
430	0	Hi.
431	0	"There are 3.3 million Muslims in the United States, and I'm one of them."
432	0	"You've mentioned working with Muslim nations, but with Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?"
433	0	"Mr. Trump, you're first."
434	0	"Well, you're right about Islamophobia, and that's a shame."
435	0	But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem.
436	0	"I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem."
437	0	And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on.
438	0	"When they see hatred going on, they have to report it."
439	1	"As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people."
440	0	Horribly wounded.
441	0	They'll never be the same.
442	0	Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.
443	0	"And, you know, there's always a reason for everything."
444	0	"If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center."
445	0	Go outside.
446	0	Look at Paris.
447	0	Look at that horrible -- these are radical Islamic terrorists.
448	0	And she won't even mention the word and nor will President Obama.
449	0	"He won't use the term ""radical Islamic terrorism."""
450	0	"Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name."
451	0	She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name.
452	0	But the name is there.
453	0	It's radical Islamic terror.
454	0	"And before you solve it, you have to say the name."
455	0	Secretary Clinton?
456	0	"Well, thank you for asking your question."
457	0	"And I've heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there's been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims."
458	0	"And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald."
459	0	I want to say just a couple of things.
460	0	"First, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington."
461	0	And we've had many successful Muslims.
462	0	We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.
463	0	"My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you're willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community."
464	0	That's what America is.
465	0	That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.
466	0	It's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims.
467	0	We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines.
468	0	I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America.
469	0	"I've met with a lot of them, and I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see."
470	0	"It's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations."
471	0	"Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans?"
472	0	"And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists."
473	0	We are not at war with Islam.
474	0	And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are.
475	0	So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.
476	0	"Thank you, Secretary Clinton."
477	0	"Mr. Trump, in December, you said this."
478	0	Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.
479	0	We have no choice.
480	0	We have no choice.
481	0	Your running mate said this week that the Muslim ban is no longer your position.
482	0	Is that correct?
483	0	"And if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test?"
484	0	"First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq."
485	0	Iraq was disaster.
486	0	So he would have been alive today.
487	0	The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.
488	0	Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands -- excuse me.
489	0	Excuse me..
490	0	And why did it morph into that?
491	0	"No, did you -- no, answer the question."
492	0	Do you still believe...
493	0	Why don't you interrupt her?
494	0	You interrupt me all the time.
495	0	I do.
496	0	Why don't you interrupt her?
497	0	Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?
498	0	It's called extreme vetting.
499	0	We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama.
500	0	And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama.
501	0	"People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more."
502	0	This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.
503	0	We have enough problems in this country.
504	0	I believe in building safe zones.
505	0	"I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people."
506	0	"But I don't want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them."
507	0	We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.
508	0	"And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees."
509	0	We know you want tougher vetting.
510	0	That's not a perfect system.
511	0	So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?
512	0	"Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us."
513	0	"But there are a lot of refugees, women and children -- think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces."
514	0	"There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression."
515	0	And we need to do our part.
516	0	We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are.
517	0	"But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others."
518	0	"But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion."
519	0	How do you do that?
520	0	We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty.
521	0	How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county?
522	0	Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country?
523	0	And how do we expect to be able to implement those?
524	0	So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous.
525	0	"And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us."
526	0	"And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he's denied being for the war in Iraq."
527	0	We have it on tape.
528	0	The entire press corps has looked at it.
529	0	"It's been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say."
530	0	That's not been debunked.
531	0	"So, please..."
532	0	That has not been debunked.
533	0	go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.
534	1	I was against -- I was against the war in Iraq.
535	0	Has not been debunked.
536	0	And you voted for it.
537	0	And you shouldn't have.
538	0	"Well, I just want to say..."
539	0	There's been lots of fact-checking on that.
540	0	I'd like to move on to an online question...
541	0	Excuse me.
542	0	She just went about 25 seconds over her time.
543	0	She did not.
544	0	"Could I just respond to this, please?"
545	0	"Very quickly, please."
546	0	"Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens."
547	0	"When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don't want them."
548	0	"In some cases, they're murderers, drug lords, drug problems."
549	0	And they don't want them.
550	0	"And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that's OK, we can't force it into their country."
551	0	"Let me tell you, I'm going to force them right back into their country."
552	0	They're murderers and some very bad people.
553	0	"And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you've never seen."
554	0	We're also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip.
555	0	At a record clip.
556	0	And it shouldn't be allowed to happen.
557	0	ICE just endorsed me.
558	0	They've never endorsed a presidential candidate.
559	0	"The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border."
560	0	She doesn't.
561	0	She wants amnesty for everybody.
562	0	Come right in.
563	0	Come right over.
564	0	It's a horrible thing she's doing.
565	0	"She's got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States."
566	0	That I can tell you.
567	0	"Thank you, Mr. Trump."
568	0	I want to move on.
569	0	"This next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition's online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes."
570	0	"This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton's paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues."
571	0	"So, Tu (ph), from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced?"
572	0	Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues?
573	0	"Secretary Clinton, your two minutes."
574	0	"Well, right."
575	0	"As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called ""Lincoln."""
576	0	It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment.
577	0	"It was principled, and it was strategic."
578	0	And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it.
579	0	"And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments."
580	0	That was a great -- I thought a great display of presidential leadership.
581	0	"But, you know, let's talk about what's really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election."
582	0	"And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don't even know if it's accurate information, and then they put it out."
583	0	"We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election."
584	0	"And believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected."
585	0	They're doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.
586	0	"Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don't know the reasons."
587	0	But we deserve answers.
588	0	And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has...
589	0	We're going to get to that later.
590	0	"Secretary Clinton, you're out of time."
591	0	with the Russians and other foreign powers.
592	0	Mr. Trump?
593	0	"Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous."
594	0	"Look, now she's blaming -- she got caught in a total lie."
595	0	"Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out."
596	0	And she lied.
597	0	"Now she's blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln."
598	0	That's one that I haven't...
599	0	(LAUGHTER)
600	0	"OK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied."
601	0	That's the good thing.
602	0	That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.
603	0	"That's a big, big difference."
604	0	We're talking about some difference.
605	0	"But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don't know Putin."
606	0	"I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example."
607	0	But I don't know Putin.
608	1	"But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are -- she doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking."
609	0	Maybe there is no hacking.
610	0	But they always blame Russia.
611	0	And the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia.
612	0	I know nothing about Russia.
613	0	"I know -- I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia."
614	0	I don't deal there.
615	0	I have no businesses there.
616	0	I have no loans from Russia.
617	0	"I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office."
618	0	"One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet."
619	0	But I have no loans with Russia.
620	0	"You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have."
621	0	"Now, the taxes are a very simple thing."
622	0	"As soon as I have -- first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes."
623	0	Many of her friends took bigger deductions.
624	0	Warren Buffett took a massive deduction.
625	0	"Soros, who's a friend of hers, took a massive deduction."
626	0	Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her -- took massive deductions.
627	0	I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.
628	0	"But -- but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns."
629	0	I'll be very proud to.
630	0	They're actually quite great.
631	0	"Thank you, Mr. Trump."
632	0	"We want to turn, actually, to the topic of taxes."
633	0	We have a question from Spencer Maass.
634	0	Spencer?
635	0	Good evening.
636	0	"My question is, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes?"
637	0	"Mr. Trump, you have two minutes."
638	0	"Well, one thing I'd do is get rid of carried interest."
639	0	"One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code."
640	0	"And she could have done this years ago, by the way."
641	0	She's a United States -- she was a United States senator.
642	0	She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code.
643	0	"Well, why didn't she change it?"
644	0	Why didn't you change it when you were a senator?
645	0	The reason you didn't is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do.
646	0	And I do.
647	0	"You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change."
648	0	"But you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump."
649	0	But -- and I say that about a lot of things.
650	0	"You know, I've heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years."
651	0	I wish you would have done this.
652	0	But she's been there for 30 years she's been doing this stuff.
653	0	She never changed.
654	0	And she never will change.
655	0	She never will change.
656	0	We're getting rid of carried interest provisions.
657	0	"I'm lowering taxes actually, because I think it's so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving -- massive corporations and little ones, little ones can't form."
658	0	We're getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.
659	0	But we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent.
660	0	We're cutting taxes for the middle class.
661	0	"And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class."
662	1	"And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks."
663	0	You can look at me.
664	1	She's raising your taxes really high.
665	0	And what that's going to do is a disaster for the country.
666	1	But she is raising your taxes and I'm lowering your taxes.
667	0	That in itself is a big difference.
668	0	We are going to be thriving again.
669	0	We have no growth in this country.
670	0	There's no growth.
671	0	"If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe."
672	0	We're down at 1 percent.
673	0	"And that's, like, no growth."
674	0	"And we're going lower, in my opinion."
675	0	"And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world."
676	0	And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world.
677	0	And I think it's so important -- one of the most important things we can do.
678	1	But she is raising everybody's taxes massively.
679	0	"Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes."
680	0	"The question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes?"
681	0	"Well, everything you've heard just now from Donald is not true."
682	0	"I'm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality."
683	0	And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn't paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he's going to do.
684	0	But I'll tell you what he's going to do.
685	0	"His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two."
686	0	"Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift."
687	1	"And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families."
688	0	"Now, here's what I want to do."
689	0	"I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year -- and that's the vast majority of Americans as you know -- will have their taxes raised, because I think we've got to go where the money is."
690	0	And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.
691	0	"And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes."
692	0	"I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes."
693	0	I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars.
694	0	It's called the Buffett rule.
695	0	"Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who's gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary."
696	0	I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.
697	0	"We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you."
698	0	I want to invest in hard-working families.
699	1	"And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top."
700	0	And we need to reverse that.
701	0	"People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong."
702	0	"Thank you, Secretary."
703	0	"And we're going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country."
704	0	Thank you.
705	0	"I want to give you -- Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond."
706	0	I just wanted to tell our viewers what she's referring to.
707	0	"In the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign."
708	0	The New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns.
709	0	"They show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years."
710	0	"You've said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes."
711	0	"You have not answered, though, a simple question."
712	0	Did you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years?
713	0	Of course I do.
714	0	Of course I do.
715	0	"And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors."
716	0	I know many of her donors.
717	0	Her donors took massive tax write-offs.
718	0	So have you (inaudible) personal federal income tax?
719	0	"A lot of my -- excuse me, Anderson -- a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed."
720	0	"And she'll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it."
721	0	That's why.
722	0	"See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president."
723	0	"Hillary Clinton -- and it's extremely complex -- Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people."
724	0	"But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary's leaving."
725	0	Very interesting why she's leaving carried interest.
726	0	"But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes."
727	0	I absolutely used it.
728	0	And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from.
729	0	"Now, I won't mention their names, because they're rich, but they're not famous."
730	0	So we won't make them famous.
731	0	So can you -- can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes?
732	0	"No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too."
733	0	"But I have a write-off, a lot of it's depreciation, which is a wonderful charge."
734	0	I love depreciation.
735	0	"You know, she's given it to us."
736	0	"Hey, if she had a problem -- for 30 years she's been doing this, Anderson."
737	0	I say it all the time.
738	0	She talks about health care.
739	0	Why didn't she do something about it?
740	0	She talks about taxes.
741	0	Why didn't she do something about it?
742	0	She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk.
743	0	"With her, it's all talk and no action."
744	0	In the past...
745	0	"And, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment."
746	0	She has made bad judgment not only on taxes.
747	0	"She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq."
748	1	"I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they've left, that's why ISIS formed in the first place."
749	0	"They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary."
750	0	Congratulations.
751	0	Great job.
752	0	"Secretary -- I want you to be able to respond, Secretary Clinton."
753	0	"Well, here we go again."
754	0	"I've been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York."
755	0	But that's not the point here.
756	0	Why didn't you do it?
757	0	Why didn't you do it?
758	0	Allow her to respond.
759	0	Because I was a senator with a Republican president.
760	0	"Oh, really?"
761	0	I will be the president and we will get it done.
762	0	That's exactly right.
763	0	"You could have done it, if you were an effective -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it."
764	0	"If you were an effective senator, you could have done it."
765	0	But you were not an effective senator.
766	0	Please allow her to respond.
767	0	She didn't interrupt you.
768	0	"You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power."
769	0	"Look, he has now said repeatedly, ""30 years this and 30 years that."""
770	0	So let me talk about my 30 years in public service.
771	0	I'm very glad to do so.
772	0	"Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children's Health Insurance Program."
773	0	Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system.
774	0	"After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it."
775	0	"Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done."
776	0	"When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women's rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons."
777	0	Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.
778	0	I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.
779	0	"And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington."
780	0	"Thank you, secretary."
781	0	"I've proven that I can, and for 30 years, I've produced results for people."
782	0	"Thank you, secretary."
783	0	We're going to move on to Syria.
784	0	Both of you have mentioned that.
785	0	She said a lot of things that were false.
786	0	"I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe..."
787	0	"No, we can -- no, Mr. Trump, we're going to go on."
788	0	This is about the audience.
789	0	Excuse me.
790	0	Because she has been a disaster as a senator.
791	0	A disaster.
792	0	"Mr. Trump, we're going to move on."
793	0	"The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world's attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone."
794	0	"But there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children."
795	0	"Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo."
796	0	So this next question comes through social media through Facebook.
797	0	"Diane from Pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo?"
798	0	Isn't it a lot like the Holocaust when the U.S. waited too long before we helped?
799	0	"Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes."
800	0	"Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic."
801	0	"And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left."
802	0	And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.
803	0	Russia hasn't paid any attention to ISIS.
804	0	They're interested in keeping Assad in power.
805	0	"So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones."
806	0	"We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them."
807	0	And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.
808	0	But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.
809	0	"Russia has decided that it's all in, in Syria."
810	0	"And they've also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it's not me."
811	0	I've stood up to Russia.
812	0	"I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president."
813	0	"I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that's fine."
814	0	And I did as secretary of state.
815	1	That's how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons.
816	0	It's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot.
817	0	So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.
818	0	"But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable."
819	0	"Thank you, Secretary Clinton."
820	0	Mr. Trump?
821	0	"First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which..."
822	0	"No, I wasn't."
823	0	I was gone.
824	0	"I hate to interrupt you, but at some point..."
825	0	OK.
826	0	But you were in contact -- excuse me.
827	0	You were...
828	0	"At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here."
829	0	"You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you."
830	0	I don't think he would be listening to you very much anymore.
831	0	Obama draws the line in the sand.
832	0	It was laughed at all over the world what happened.
833	0	"Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia."
834	0	"But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they've gone wild with their nuclear program."
835	0	Not good.
836	0	Our government shouldn't have allowed that to happen.
837	0	Russia is new in terms of nuclear.
838	0	We are old.
839	0	We're tired.
840	0	We're exhausted in terms of nuclear.
841	0	A very bad thing.
842	0	"Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad."
843	0	She talks in favor of the rebels.
844	0	She doesn't even know who the rebels are.
845	0	"You know, every time we take rebels, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else, we're arming people."
846	0	And you know what happens?
847	0	They end up being worse than the people.
848	0	Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi.
849	0	Gadhafi's out.
850	0	It's a mess.
851	1	"And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil."
852	0	I'm sure you probably have heard that.
853	0	It was a disaster.
854	0	"Because the fact is, almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster."
855	0	"But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn't there, but possibly she's consulted."
856	0	We sign a peace treaty.
857	0	Everyone's all excited.
858	0	"Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room."
859	0	But look at that deal.
860	0	Iran now and Russia are now against us.
861	0	So she wants to fight.
862	0	She wants to fight for rebels.
863	0	There's only one problem.
864	0	You don't even know who the rebels are.
865	0	So what's the purpose?
866	0	"Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your two minutes is up."
867	0	And one thing I have to say.
868	0	Your two minutes is up.
869	0	"I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS."
870	0	Russia is killing ISIS.
871	0	And Iran is killing ISIS.
872	0	And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.
873	0	"Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question."
874	0	If you were president...
875	0	(LAUGHTER)
876	0	what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo?
877	0	And I want to remind you what your running mate said.
878	0	"He said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime."
879	0	OK.
880	0	"He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree."
881	0	I disagree.
882	0	You disagree with your running mate?
883	0	I think you have to knock out ISIS.
884	0	"Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS."
885	0	We have people that want to fight both at the same time.
886	0	But Syria is no longer Syria.
887	0	"Syria is Russia and it's Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly."
888	0	I believe we have to get ISIS.
889	0	We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved.
890	0	She had a chance to do something with Syria.
891	0	They had a chance.
892	0	And that was the line.
893	0	And she didn't.
894	0	What do you think will happen if Aleppo falls?
895	0	"I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise."
896	0	What do you think will happen if it falls?
897	0	I think that it basically has fallen.
898	0	OK?
899	0	It basically has fallen.
900	0	Let me tell you something.
901	0	You take a look at Mosul.
902	0	"The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul."
903	0	They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul.
904	0	"So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks."
905	0	"Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul."
906	0	Why can't they do it quietly?
907	0	"Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success?"
908	0	People leave.
909	0	"Why do they have to say we're going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they're saying?"
910	0	How stupid is our country?
911	0	There are sometimes reasons the military does that.
912	0	Psychological warfare.
913	0	I can't think of any.
914	0	I can't think of any.
915	0	And I'm pretty good at it.
916	0	It might be to help get civilians out.
917	0	And we have General Flynn.
918	0	"And we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me."
919	0	I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me.
920	0	We talk about it all the time.
921	0	"They understand, why can't they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership?"
922	0	How -- why would these people stay there?
923	0	I've been reading now...
924	0	Tell me what your strategy is.
925	0	"for weeks -- I've been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it's the harbor of where -- you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are."
926	0	Why would they be saying -- they're not staying there anymore.
927	0	They're gone.
928	0	"Because everybody's talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul."
929	0	"Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can't believe it."
930	0	All I say is this.
931	0	"General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East."
932	0	I'm going to go to Secretary Clinton.
933	0	"Secretary Clinton, you want Assad to go."
934	0	"You advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo."
935	0	You talk about diplomatic efforts.
936	0	Those have failed.
937	0	Cease-fires have failed.
938	0	Would you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy?
939	0	I would not use American ground forces in Syria.
940	0	I think that would be a very serious mistake.
941	0	"I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force."
942	0	I don't think that is a smart strategy.
943	0	"I do think the use of special forces, which we're using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just..."
944	0	But what would you do differently than President Obama is doing?
945	0	"Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I -- if I'm fortunate..."
946	0	Everything.
947	0	I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq.
948	0	I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul.
949	0	"And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals."
950	0	"No, he doesn't."
951	0	"There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this."
952	0	And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.
953	0	I would go after Baghdadi.
954	0	"I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders -- and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones -- made a difference."
955	0	So I think that could help.
956	0	I would also consider arming the Kurds.
957	0	"The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq."
958	0	"And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq."
959	0	Thank you very much.
960	0	We're going to move on...
961	0	You know what's funny?
962	0	"She went over a minute over, and you don't stop her."
963	0	"When I go one second over, it's like a big deal."
964	0	You had many answers.
965	0	It's really -- it's really very interesting.
966	0	We've got a question over here from James Carter.
967	0	Mr. Carter?
968	0	"My question is, do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the United States?"
969	0	That question begins for Mr. Trump.
970	0	Absolutely.
971	0	"I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable."
972	0	I will be a president for all of our people.
973	0	And I'll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.
974	1	"Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world."
975	0	Not in this country.
976	1	It stripped us of manufacturing jobs.
977	0	We lost our jobs.
978	0	We lost our money.
979	0	We lost our plants.
980	0	It is a disaster.
981	0	"And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she's for it."
982	0	She called it the gold standard.
983	0	"And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn't say it."
984	0	They actually said that she lied.
985	0	OK?
986	0	And she lied.
987	0	But she's lied about a lot of things.
988	0	"I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities."
989	0	Devastating what's happening to our inner cities.
990	0	She's been talking about it for years.
991	0	"As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens."
992	0	She doesn't get it done.
993	0	"Same with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans."
994	0	The same exact thing.
995	0	"They talk, they don't get it done."
996	0	You go into the inner cities and -- you see it's 45 percent poverty.
997	0	African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities.
998	0	The education is a disaster.
999	0	Jobs are essentially nonexistent.
1000	0	"I mean, it's -- you know, and I've been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose?"
1001	0	It can't get any worse.
1002	0	And she's been talking about the inner cities for 25 years.
1003	0	Nothing's going to ever happen.
1004	0	"Let me tell you, if she's president of the United States, nothing's going to happen."
1005	0	It's just going to be talk.
1006	0	"And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis."
1007	0	She's not doing any me favors.
1008	0	"But by doing all the others' favors, she's doing me favors."
1009	0	"Mr. Trump, thank you."
1010	0	"But I will tell you, she's all talk."
1011	0	It doesn't get done.
1012	0	All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run.
1013	0	Take a look at upstate New York.
1014	0	Your two minutes is up.
1015	0	"Secretary Clinton, two minutes?"
1016	0	It turned out to be a disaster.
1017	0	"You have two minutes, Secretary Clinton."
1018	0	"Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that."
1019	0	"Mr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families."
1020	0	"You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund."
1021	0	"And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I've been in public service."
1022	0	I'm proud of that.
1023	0	"You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system."
1024	0	"I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about."
1025	0	I have worked with Latinos -- one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote.
1026	0	"So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country."
1027	0	"And I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn't have a place in Donald Trump's America."
1028	0	"They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix."
1029	0	She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler.
1030	0	He's 10 years old now.
1031	0	This is the only one country he's ever known.
1032	0	"And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?"
1033	0	"You know, children listen to what is being said."
1034	0	"To go back to the very, very first question."
1035	0	"And there's a lot of fear -- in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect."
1036	0	Bullying is up.
1037	0	"A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy."
1038	0	A lot of kids are expressing their concerns.
1039	0	"So, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody."
1040	0	"Your time, Secretary Clinton."
1041	0	"Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country."
1042	0	"If you don't vote for me, I still want to be your president."
1043	0	Your two minutes is up.
1044	0	I want to be the best president I can be for every American.
1045	0	"Secretary Clinton, your two minutes is up."
1046	0	"I want to follow up on something that Donald Trump actually said to you, a comment you made last month."
1047	0	"You said that half of Donald Trump's supporters are, quote, ""deplorables, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic."""
1048	0	You later said you regretted saying half.
1049	0	"You didn't express regret for using the term ""deplorables."""
1050	0	"To Mr. Carter's question, how can you unite a country if you've written off tens of millions of Americans?"
1051	0	"Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters."
1052	0	"It's with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans."
1053	0	"And what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he's never apologized for."
1054	0	And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said -- I'm proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran.
1055	0	"We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults."
1056	0	And he is supporting me 100 percent.
1057	0	Thank you.
1058	0	Because we talked about what we wanted to do.
1059	0	"We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates..."
1060	0	"Thank you, Secretary."
1061	0	but we believed that we could make the country better.
1062	0	And I was proud of that.
1063	0	I want to give you a minute to respond.
1064	0	We have a divided nation.
1065	0	We have a very divided nation.
1066	0	You look at Charlotte.
1067	0	You look at Baltimore.
1068	0	"You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C."
1069	0	"We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years."
1070	0	"We have a divided nation, because people like her -- and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart."
1071	0	"And when she said deplorables, she meant it."
1072	0	"And when she said irredeemable, they're irredeemable, you didn't mention that, but when she said they're irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse."
1073	0	She said some of them are irredeemable.
1074	0	She's got tremendous -- she's got tremendous hatred.
1075	0	"And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that's what you're getting with her."
1076	0	"Mr. Trump, let me follow up with you."
1077	0	"In 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline."
1078	0	"You said, if a leader doesn't have it, quote, ""he or she won't be one for very long."""
1079	1	"In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape."
1080	0	Is that the discipline of a good leader?
1081	0	"No, there wasn't check out a sex tape."
1082	0	It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.
1083	0	You mentioned sex tape.
1084	0	"By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o'clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi."
1085	0	She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning?
1086	0	Guess what?
1087	0	"She didn't answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens..."
1088	0	"The question is, is that the discipline of a good leader?"
1089	0	"600 -- wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times."
1090	0	"Well, she said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I won't even mention that."
1091	0	But she said she'll be awake.
1092	0	"Who's going -- the famous thing, we're going to answer our call at 3 o'clock in the morning."
1093	0	Guess what happened?
1094	1	Ambassador Stevens -- Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help.
1095	0	"And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who's her friend and not a good guy, by the way."
1096	0	"So, you know, she shouldn't be talking about that."
1097	0	"Now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication."
1098	0	"I mean, you can like it or not like it."
1099	0	"I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people."
1100	0	It's a very effective way of communication.
1101	0	"So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication."
1102	0	"I'm not un-proud of it, to be honest with you."
1103	0	"Secretary Clinton, does Mr. Trump have the discipline to be a good leader?"
1104	0	No.
1105	0	I'm shocked to hear that.
1106	0	(LAUGHTER)
1107	0	"Well, it's not only my opinion."
1108	0	"It's the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress."
1109	0	"But it's in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody."
1110	0	Everybody.
1111	0	African-American incomes went up 33 percent.
1112	0	"And it's not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you've got it, and he never wavered."
1113	0	He stuck with me.
1114	0	And I have worked and I admire President Obama.
1115	0	He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
1116	0	That was a terrible time for our country.
1117	0	We have to move along.
1118	0	Nine million people lost their jobs.
1119	0	"Secretary Clinton, we have to..."
1120	0	Five million homes were lost.
1121	0	"Secretary Clinton, we're moving."
1122	0	And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.
1123	0	We are back on the right track.
1124	0	He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.
1125	0	"Secretary Clinton, we are moving to an audience question."
1126	0	We're almost out of time.
1127	0	We have another...
1128	0	We have the slowest growth since 1929.
1129	0	We're moving to an audience question.
1130	0	It is -- our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.
1131	0	"Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton, we want to get to the audience."
1132	0	Thank you very much both of you.
1133	0	(LAUGHTER)
1134	0	We have another audience question.
1135	0	Beth Miller has a question for both candidates.
1136	0	Good evening.
1137	0	Perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the Supreme Court justice.
1138	0	What would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a Supreme Court justice?
1139	0	"We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton."
1140	0	Thank you.
1141	0	"Well, you're right."
1142	0	This is one of the most important issues in this election.
1143	0	"I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against."
1144	0	Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction.
1145	0	"And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics."
1146	0	Donald doesn't agree with that.
1147	0	"I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don't always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise."
1148	0	"I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality."
1149	0	"Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider."
1150	0	And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality.
1151	0	I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.
1152	0	I want a Supreme Court that doesn't always side with corporate interests.
1153	0	I want a Supreme Court that understands because you're wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn't mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.
1154	0	So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court.
1155	0	"And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they've not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices."
1156	0	I think that was a dereliction of duty.
1157	0	"I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people."
1158	0	"Thank you, Secretary Clinton."
1159	0	Thank you.
1160	0	You're out of time.
1161	0	Mr. Trump?
1162	0	"Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently."
1163	0	And we have a vacancy.
1164	0	I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.
1165	0	"I'm looking for judges -- and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody."
1166	0	But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States.
1167	0	And I think that this is so important.
1168	0	"Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton."
1169	0	"They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents."
1170	0	So important to me.
1171	0	"Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand."
1172	0	"So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in -- of my money, meaning I'm not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she's doing."
1173	0	What I ask is this.
1174	0	"So I'm putting in more than -- by the time it's finished, I'll have more than $100 million invested."
1175	0	Pretty much self-funding money.
1176	0	"We're raising money for the Republican Party, and we're doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so."
1177	0	"I ask Hillary, why doesn't -- she made $250 million by being in office."
1178	0	She used the power of her office to make a lot of money.
1179	0	"Why isn't she funding, not for $100 million, but why don't you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?"
1180	0	"It's $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public."
1181	0	Why aren't you putting some money in?
1182	0	You have a lot of it.
1183	0	You've made a lot of it because of the fact that you've been in office.
1184	0	"Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually."
1185	0	So why aren't you putting money into your own campaign?
1186	0	I'm just curious.
1187	0	Well...
1188	0	(CROSSTALK)
1189	0	Thank you very much.
1190	0	We're going to get on to one more question.
1191	0	The question was about the Supreme Court.
1192	0	"And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment."
1193	0	"But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole."
1194	0	Thank you.
1195	0	"We have -- we have one more question, Mrs. Clinton."
1196	0	We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.
1197	0	We have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy.
1198	0	Ken?
1199	0	"What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?"
1200	0	"Mr. Trump, two minutes?"
1201	0	Absolutely.
1202	0	"I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration."
1203	0	Under absolutely siege.
1204	0	"The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies."
1205	0	And foreign companies are now coming in buying our -- buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.
1206	0	We are killing -- absolutely killing our energy business in this country.
1207	0	"Now, I'm all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera."
1208	0	But we need much more than wind and solar.
1209	0	And you look at our miners.
1210	1	Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.
1211	0	There is a thing called clean coal.
1212	0	"Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country."
1213	0	Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology.
1214	0	"We have unbelievable -- we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet."
1215	0	So good.
1216	0	Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.
1217	0	I will bring our energy companies back.
1218	0	They'll be able to compete.
1219	0	They'll make money.
1220	0	They'll pay off our national debt.
1221	0	"They'll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous."
1222	0	But we are putting our energy companies out of business.
1223	0	We have to bring back our workers.
1224	0	"You take a look at what's happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies."
1225	0	We have to guard our energy companies.
1226	0	We have to make it possible.
1227	0	The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business.
1228	0	"And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business."
1229	0	It's a disgrace.
1230	0	Your time is up.
1231	0	Thank you.
1232	0	It's an absolute disgrace.
1233	0	"Secretary Clinton, two minutes."
1234	0	"And actually -- well, that was very interesting."
1235	0	"First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business."
1236	0	That's something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.
1237	1	"You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent."
1238	0	We are not dependent upon the Middle East.
1239	0	But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices.
1240	0	So the price of oil has been way down.
1241	0	"And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right?"
1242	0	"We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels."
1243	0	And I think that's an important transition.
1244	0	We've got to remain energy-independent.
1245	0	It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East.
1246	0	We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.
1247	0	"So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem."
1248	0	"And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses."
1249	0	But I also want to be sure that we don't leave people behind.
1250	0	"That's why I'm the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out."
1251	0	A lot of them lost their lives.
1252	0	"They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories."
1253	0	I don't want to walk away from them.
1254	0	So we've got to do something for them.
1255	0	Secretary Clinton...
1256	0	But the price of coal is down worldwide.
1257	0	So we have to look at this comprehensively.
1258	0	Your time is up.
1259	0	And that's exactly what I have proposed.
1260	0	I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.
1261	0	Time is up.
1262	0	We have time for one more...
1263	0	We have...
1264	0	One more audience question.
1265	0	"We've sneaked in one more question, and it comes from Karl Becker."
1266	0	Good evening.
1267	0	"My question to both of you is, regardless of the current rhetoric, would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another?"
1268	0	(APPLAUSE)
1269	0	"Mr. Trump, would you like to go first?"
1270	0	"Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question."
1271	0	"Look, I respect his children."
1272	0	"His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald."
1273	0	"I don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that."
1274	0	And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.
1275	0	"So I believe that this election has become in part so -- so conflict-oriented, so intense because there's a lot at stake."
1276	0	"This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election."
1277	0	"We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake."
1278	0	It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.
1279	0	"And that's why I've tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president."
1280	0	"And that's why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I've spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families."
1281	0	And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.
1282	0	Mr. Trump?
1283	0	"Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment."
1284	0	"I don't know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great -- I'm very proud of my children."
1285	0	"And they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids."
1286	0	So I consider that a compliment.
1287	0	I will say this about Hillary.
1288	0	She doesn't quit.
1289	0	She doesn't give up.
1290	0	I respect that.
1291	0	I tell it like it is.
1292	0	She's a fighter.
1293	0	I disagree with much of what she's fighting for.
1294	0	I do disagree with her judgment in many cases.
1295	0	"But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up."
1296	0	And I consider that to be a very good trait.
1297	0	Thanks to both of you.
1298	0	We want to thank both the candidates.
1299	0	We want to thank the university here.
1300	0	This concludes the town hall meeting.
1301	0	"Our thanks to the candidates, the commission, Washington University, and to everybody who watched."
1302	0	"Please tune in on October 19th for the final presidential debate that will take place at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas."
1303	0	"Good night, everyone."
1	0	"Good evening from the Thomas and Mack Center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas."
2	0	"I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News, and I welcome you to the third and final of the 2016 presidential debates between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump."
3	0	This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.
4	0	"The commission has designed the format: Six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment."
5	0	Both campaigns have agreed to those rules.
6	0	"For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic."
7	0	None of those questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates.
8	0	The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent.
9	0	"No cheers, boos, or other interruptions so we and you can focus on what the candidates have to say."
10	0	"No noise, except right now, as we welcome the Democratic nominee for president, Secretary Clinton, and the Republican nominee for president, Mr. Trump."
11	0	(APPLAUSE)
12	0	"Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, welcome."
13	0	Let's get right to it.
14	0	The first topic is the Supreme Court.
15	0	"You both talked briefly about the court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this, because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments."
16	0	"Which means that you will, in effect, determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century."
17	0	"First of all, where do you want to see the court take the country?"
18	0	"And secondly, what's your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted?"
19	0	Do the founders' words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances?
20	0	"In this segment, Secretary Clinton, you go first."
21	0	You have two minutes.
22	0	"Thank you very much, Chris."
23	0	And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.
24	0	"You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be?"
25	0	What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens?
26	0	What kind of rights will Americans have?
27	0	"And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy."
28	0	"For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system."
29	0	I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.
30	0	"But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us."
31	0	"That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans."
32	0	And I look forward to having that opportunity.
33	0	I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them.
34	0	That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate.
35	0	"The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process."
36	0	"Secretary Clinton, thank you."
37	0	"Mr. Trump, same question."
38	0	Where do you want to see the court take the country?
39	0	And how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted?
40	0	"Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody."
41	0	The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.
42	0	"Our country is so, so -- it's just so imperative that we have the right justices."
43	0	"Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent."
44	0	And she was forced to apologize.
45	0	And apologize she did.
46	0	"But these were statements that should never, ever have been made."
47	0	"We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege."
48	0	"I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now."
49	0	"But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma."
50	0	I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I've named 20 of them -- the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life.
51	0	They will have a conservative bent.
52	0	They will be protecting the Second Amendment.
53	0	"They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect."
54	0	They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted.
55	0	"And I believe that's very, very important."
56	0	I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear.
57	0	"It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be."
58	0	And those are the people that I will appoint.
59	0	"Mr. Trump, thank you."
60	0	We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion.
61	0	"I want to focus on two issues that, in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land."
62	0	"First is one that you mentioned, Mr. Trump, and that is guns."
63	0	"Secretary Clinton, you said last year, let me quote, ""The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment."""
64	0	"And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case, the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but a right that is reasonably limited."
65	0	Those were the words of the Judge Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision.
66	0	What's wrong with that?
67	0	"Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment."
68	0	I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years.
69	0	I represented upstate New York.
70	0	I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.
71	0	It goes back to the founding of our country.
72	0	But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.
73	0	"Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family."
74	1	"And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns."
75	0	"I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole."
76	0	There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.
77	0	You mentioned the Heller decision.
78	1	"And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them."
79	0	"And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others."
80	0	So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment.
81	0	Let me bring Mr. Trump in here.
82	0	"The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here, and this was, in fact, one of the top questions that they got."
83	0	How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected?
84	0	You just heard Secretary Clinton's answer.
85	0	"Does she persuade you that, while you may disagree on regulation, that, in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms?"
86	0	"Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it."
87	0	I watched.
88	0	"I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld."
89	0	And Justice Scalia was so involved.
90	0	And it was a well-crafted decision.
91	0	"But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry."
92	0	And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say.
93	0	"Well, let me bring in Secretary Clinton."
94	0	Were you extremely upset?
95	0	"Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions."
96	0	"But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms."
97	0	"That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation."
98	0	"And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA."
99	0	The gun lobby's on his side.
100	0	They're running millions of dollars of ads against me.
101	0	"And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment."
102	0	"But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year."
103	0	"Let me bring Mr. Trump back into this, because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high- capacity magazines."
104	0	You support a national right to carry law.
105	0	"Why, sir?"
106	0	"Well, let me just tell you before we go any further."
107	1	"In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city."
108	1	"So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence."
109	0	I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment.
110	0	"And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA."
111	0	And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president.
112	0	So I'm very honored by all of that.
113	0	We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment.
114	0	"We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment."
115	0	"Well, let's pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and that's the issue of abortion."
116	0	Right.
117	0	"Mr. Trump, you're pro-life."
118	0	"But I want to ask you specifically: Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes -- in fact, states -- a woman's right to abortion?"
119	0	"Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states."
120	0	But I'm asking you specifically.
121	0	Would you like to...
122	0	"If they overturned it, it will go back to the states."
123	0	"But what I'm asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturn -- you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment."
124	0	Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade?
125	0	"Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen."
126	0	"And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court."
127	0	"I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination."
128	0	Secretary Clinton?
129	0	"Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine."
130	0	"And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade."
131	0	It is about what's happening right now in America.
132	0	"So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country."
133	1	Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.
134	1	He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood.
135	0	I will defend Planned Parenthood.
136	0	"I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions."
137	0	Secretary Clinton…
138	0	And we have come too far to have that turned back now.
139	1	"And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions."
140	0	And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.
141	0	"I'm going to give you a chance to respond, but I want to ask you, Secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes."
142	0	You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights.
143	0	"You also voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions."
144	0	Why?
145	0	Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account.
146	0	"And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case."
147	0	"The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make."
148	0	"I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy."
149	0	I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.
150	0	So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.
151	0	"Mr. Trump, your reaction?"
152	0	"And particularly on this issue of late-term, partial-birth abortions."
153	0	"Well, I think it's terrible."
154	1	"If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby."
155	0	"Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK."
156	1	"But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day."
157	0	And that's not acceptable.
158	0	"Well, that is not what happens in these cases."
159	0	And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.
160	0	"You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life."
161	0	This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make.
162	0	And I do not believe the government should be making it.
163	0	"You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country."
164	0	"I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania."
165	0	"And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice."
166	0	And I will stand up for that right.
167	0	All right.
168	0	"But just briefly, I want to move on to another segment..."
169	0	"And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth."
170	0	Nobody has that.
171	0	All right.
172	0	Let's move on to the subject of immigration.
173	0	And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration.
174	0	"Actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you."
175	0	"Mr. Trump, you want to build a wall."
176	0	"Secretary Clinton, you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border."
177	0	"Mr. Trump, you are calling for major deportations."
178	0	"Secretary Clinton, you say that within your first 100 days as president you're going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship."
179	0	"The question, really, is, why are you right and your opponent wrong?"
180	0	"Mr. Trump, you go first in this segment."
181	0	You have two minutes.
182	0	"Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years."
183	0	We need strong borders.
184	0	"In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of -- I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally."
185	0	You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country.
186	0	They're coming in illegally.
187	0	Drugs are pouring in through the border.
188	0	We have no country if we have no border.
189	0	Hillary wants to give amnesty.
190	0	She wants to have open borders.
191	0	"The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me."
192	0	First time they've ever endorsed a candidate.
193	0	It means their job is tougher.
194	0	But they know what's going on.
195	0	They know it better than anybody.
196	0	They want strong borders.
197	0	They feel we have to have strong borders.
198	0	I was up in New Hampshire the other day.
199	0	"The biggest complaint they have -- it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama."
200	0	All of the problems -- the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border.
201	0	It's just pouring and destroying their youth.
202	0	It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.
203	0	We have to have strong borders.
204	0	We have to keep the drugs out of our country.
205	0	"We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash."
206	0	We need strong borders.
207	0	We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.
208	0	"Now, I want to build the wall."
209	0	We need the wall.
210	0	"And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall."
211	0	We stop the drugs.
212	0	We shore up the border.
213	0	"One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out."
214	0	We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border.
215	0	"And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest."
216	0	"But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out."
217	0	"Mr. Trump, thank you."
218	0	"Same question to you, Secretary Clinton."
219	0	"Basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong?"
220	0	"Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not."
221	0	"They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life."
222	0	And you're right.
223	0	I don't want to rip families apart.
224	0	I don't want to be sending parents away from children.
225	0	I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.
226	0	We have 11 million undocumented people.
227	0	"They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people."
228	0	He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.
229	0	"Now, here's what that means."
230	0	"It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented."
231	0	"And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country."
232	0	I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation.
233	0	I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.
234	0	I have been for border security for years.
235	0	I voted for border security in the United States Senate.
236	0	And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security.
237	0	But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.
238	0	"Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them."
239	0	"When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president."
240	0	Didn't even raise it.
241	0	He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.
242	0	So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.
243	0	And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship.
244	0	"Thank you, Secretary Clinton."
245	0	I want to follow up...
246	0	"Chris, I think it's..."
247	0	OK.
248	0	I think I should respond to that.
249	0	"First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico."
250	0	Very nice man.
251	0	We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals.
252	0	Believe me.
253	1	"The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody."
254	1	It's a disaster.
255	0	Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.
256	0	Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts.
257	0	"Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built."
258	0	But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.
259	0	"Well, let me -- wait, wait, sir, let me..."
260	0	We are a country of laws.
261	0	We either have -- and by the way...
262	0	"Now, wait."
263	0	I'd like to hear from...
264	0	"Well -- well, but she said one thing."
265	0	I'd like to hear -- I'd like to hear from Secretary Clinton.
266	0	"I voted for border security, and there are..."
267	0	And the wall.
268	0	There are some limited places where that was appropriate.
269	0	There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.
270	0	"But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants."
271	0	"Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages."
272	0	And Donald knows a lot about this.
273	1	He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower.
274	1	"He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: ""You complain, I'll get you deported."""
275	0	"I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers."
276	0	Mr. Trump?
277	0	President Obama has moved millions of people out.
278	0	"Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it."
279	0	"But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country."
280	0	They've been deported.
281	0	"She doesn't want to say that, but that's what's happened, and that's what happened big league."
282	0	As far as moving these people out and moving -- we either have a country or we don't.
283	0	We're a country of laws.
284	0	We either have a border or we don't.
285	0	"Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen."
286	0	But it's very unfair.
287	0	We have millions of people that did it the right way.
288	0	They're on line.
289	0	They're waiting.
290	0	"We're going to speed up the process, big league, because it's very inefficient."
291	0	But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens.
292	1	"Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders."
293	0	"You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders."
294	0	I want to...
295	1	But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.
296	0	"Secretary Clinton, I want to..."
297	0	We will not have open borders.
298	0	That is...
299	0	"Well, let me -- Secretary..."
300	0	That is a rank mischaracterization.
301	0	Secretary Clinton...
302	0	"We will have secure borders, but we'll also have reform."
303	0	And this used to be a bipartisan issue.
304	0	Ronald Reagan was the last president...
305	0	"Secretary Clinton, excuse me."
306	0	Secretary Clinton.
307	0	"to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well."
308	0	"Secretary Clinton, I want to clear up your position on this issue, because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank, for which you were paid $225,000, we've learned from the WikiLeaks, that you said this, and I want to quote."
309	1	My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.
310	0	So that's the question...
311	0	Thank you.
312	0	That's the question.
313	0	"Please quiet, everybody."
314	0	"Is that your dream, open borders?"
315	0	"Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy."
316	1	"You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined."
317	0	"And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders."
318	0	I think that would be a great benefit to us.
319	0	But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks.
320	0	And what's really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans.
321	0	"They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions."
322	0	Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet.
323	0	"This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election."
324	0	"So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past?"
325	0	Those are the questions we need answered.
326	0	We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.
327	0	Well?
328	0	"That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK?"
329	0	How did we get on to Putin?
330	0	"Hold on -- hold on, wait."
331	0	"Hold on, folks."
332	0	Because we -- this is going to end up getting out of control.
333	0	Let's try to keep it quiet so -- for the candidates and for the American people.
334	0	So just to finish on the borders...
335	0	Yes?
336	0	She wants open borders.
337	0	People are going to pour into our country.
338	0	People are going to come in from Syria.
339	0	"She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people."
340	0	They have no idea where they come from.
341	0	"And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country."
342	0	"She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama."
343	0	"So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders."
344	0	Now we can talk about Putin.
345	0	I don't know Putin.
346	0	He said nice things about me.
347	0	"If we got along well, that would be good."
348	0	"If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good."
349	0	He has no respect for her.
350	0	He has no respect for our president.
351	0	"And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads."
352	0	And she's playing chicken.
353	0	"Look, Putin..."
354	0	"Wait, but..."
355	0	"from everything I see, has no respect for this person."
356	0	"Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States."
357	0	No puppet.
358	0	No puppet.
359	0	And it's pretty clear...
360	0	You're the puppet!
361	0	It's pretty clear you won't admit...
362	0	"No, you're the puppet."
363	1	"that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race."
364	0	So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation.
365	0	We've never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election.
366	1	"We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election."
367	0	I find that deeply disturbing.
368	0	Secretary Clinton...
369	0	And I think it's time you take a stand...
370	1	"She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else."
371	0	I am not quoting myself.
372	0	She has no idea.
373	0	I am quoting 17...
374	0	"Hillary, you have no idea."
375	0	17 intelligence -- do you doubt 17 military and civilian...
376	0	And our country has no idea.
377	0	agencies.
378	0	"Yeah, I doubt it."
379	0	I doubt it.
380	0	"Well, he'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us."
381	0	I find that just absolutely...
382	0	(CROSSTALK)
383	0	She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.
384	0	Mr. Trump...
385	0	Excuse me.
386	0	Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.
387	0	Mr. Trump...
388	0	(CROSSTALK)
389	0	He's outsmarted her every step of the way.
390	0	I do get to ask some questions.
391	0	"Yes, that's fine."
392	0	And I would like to ask you this direct question.
393	0	The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks.
394	0	"Even if you don't know for sure whether they are, do you condemn any interference by Russia in the American election?"
395	0	By Russia or anybody else.
396	0	You condemn their interference?
397	0	Of course I condemn.
398	0	Of course I -- I don't know Putin.
399	0	I have no idea.
400	0	I'm not asking -- I'm asking do you condemn?
401	0	I never met Putin.
402	0	This is not my best friend.
403	0	"But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad."
404	0	"Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way."
405	0	"Whether it's Syria, you name it."
406	0	Missiles.
407	0	"Take a look at the ""start up"" that they signed."
408	0	"The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this."
409	0	"They create warheads, and we can't."
410	0	The Russians can't believe it.
411	0	She has been outsmarted by Putin.
412	0	And all you have to do is look at the Middle East.
413	0	They've taken over.
414	0	We've spent $6 trillion.
415	0	They've taken over the Middle East.
416	0	She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever.
417	0	"We're a long way away from immigration, but I'm going to let you finish this topic."
418	0	You got about 45 seconds.
419	0	And she always will be.
420	0	I -- I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons.
421	0	"This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons."
422	0	He's...
423	0	Wrong.
424	1	"advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia."
425	1	"He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them, which I think is terrifying."
426	0	But here's the deal.
427	0	"The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed."
428	0	There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
429	0	"And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button."
430	0	I have 200 generals...
431	0	Very quickly.
432	0	"and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients."
433	0	"As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the -- we're defending other countries."
434	0	We are spending a fortune doing it.
435	0	They have the bargain of the century.
436	1	"All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places."
437	0	We cannot continue to afford -- she took that as saying nuclear weapons.
438	0	OK.
439	0	"Look, she's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways."
440	0	This is just another lie.
441	0	"Well, I'm just quoting you when you were asked..."
442	1	There's no quote.
443	1	You're not going to find a quote from me.
444	1	"about a potential nuclear -- nuclear competition in Asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks."
445	0	That kind...
446	0	And defend yourselves.
447	0	of language -- well...
448	0	And defend yourselves.
449	0	I didn't say nuclear.
450	0	And defend yourself.
451	0	The United States has kept the peace -- the United States has kept the peace through our alliances.
452	0	Donald wants to tear up our alliances.
453	0	"I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer."
454	0	"I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere."
455	0	That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace.
456	0	"We're going to -- no, we are going to move on to the next topic, which is the economy."
457	0	And I hope we handle that as well as we did immigration.
458	0	You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster.
459	0	"Secretary Clinton, in your plan, government plays a big role."
460	0	"You see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties."
461	0	"Mr. Trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation."
462	0	Yes.
463	0	We're going to drill down into this a little bit more.
464	0	"But in this overview, please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent's plan will not."
465	0	"In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton."
466	0	"Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives."
467	0	"And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities."
468	0	"I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing."
469	0	"I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should."
470	0	"New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses."
471	0	I want us to do more to help small business.
472	0	That's where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from.
473	0	"I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty."
474	0	And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.
475	0	I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.
476	0	"That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future."
477	0	"I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted."
478	0	"And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is."
479	0	Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top.
480	0	So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share.
481	0	We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.
482	1	That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.
483	1	"By contrast, Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs."
484	0	Why?
485	0	"Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids."
486	0	So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities.
487	0	The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.
488	0	"Secretary, thank you."
489	0	"Mr. Trump, why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton's?"
490	0	"Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes."
491	0	Her tax plan is a disaster.
492	0	And she can say all she wants about college tuition.
493	0	And I'm a big proponent.
494	0	We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition.
495	0	But the rest of the public's going to be paying for it.
496	1	"We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan."
497	0	"But I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm -- not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries."
498	0	"Saudi Arabia, nothing but money."
499	0	We protect Saudi Arabia.
500	0	Why aren't they paying?
501	0	"She immediately -- when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO."
502	0	Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying?
503	0	Because they weren't paying.
504	0	"Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they're paying."
505	0	And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it.
506	0	"All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up."
507	0	They have to pay up.
508	0	"We're protecting people, they have to pay up."
509	0	And I'm a big fan of NATO.
510	0	But they have to pay up.
511	0	"She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great."
512	0	"Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are."
513	0	"We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out."
514	1	"We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt."
515	1	We're up to $20 trillion.
516	0	So my plan -- we're going to renegotiate trade deals.
517	0	We're going to have a lot of free trade.
518	0	"We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now."
519	0	But we have horrible deals.
520	1	"Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever."
521	1	Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy.
522	0	"You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them."
523	0	You go upstate New York.
524	1	Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places.
525	0	We're bringing our jobs back.
526	0	I am going to renegotiate NAFTA.
527	0	And if I can't make a great deal -- then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals.
528	0	"We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal."
529	0	"And if we can't, we're going to do it -- we're going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster."
530	0	We are going to cut taxes massively.
531	0	We're going to cut business taxes massively.
532	0	They're going to start hiring people.
533	0	We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion...
534	0	"Time, Mr. Trump."
535	0	that's offshore back into the country.
536	0	"We are going to start the engine rolling again, because..."
537	0	Mr. Trump?
538	0	"right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP."
539	0	"Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because..."
540	0	You can't.
541	0	"the fact is, he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration."
542	0	"I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less."
543	1	I also will not add a penny to the debt.
544	0	I have costed out what I'm going to do.
545	1	"He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt."
546	0	"Well, he mentioned the debt."
547	0	We know how to get control of the debt.
548	0	"When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt."
549	0	"When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression."
550	0	He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.
551	0	"So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people."
552	0	"So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead."
553	0	That's the kind of approach that will work.
554	0	Secretary...
555	0	"Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we've tried that."
556	0	It has not worked the way that it has been promised.
557	0	"Secretary Clinton, I want to pursue your plan, because in many ways it is similar to the Obama stimulus plan in 2009, which has led to the slowest GDP growth since 1949."
558	0	Correct.
559	0	"Thank you, sir."
560	0	You told me in July when we spoke that the problem is that President Obama didn't get to do enough in what he was trying to do with his stimulus.
561	0	So is your plan basically more -- even more of the Obama stimulus?
562	0	"Well, it's a combination, Chris."
563	0	"And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation."
564	0	I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state.
565	0	I've never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy.
566	0	I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy.
567	0	He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions.
568	0	But it was a terrible recession.
569	0	"So now we've dug ourselves out of it, we're standing, but we're not yet running."
570	0	"So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down."
571	0	That is not going to work.
572	0	"That's why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs."
573	0	"We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs."
574	0	"We've got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that's what I believe I will be able to do."
575	0	"Mr. Trump, even conservative economists who have looked at your plan say that the numbers don't add up, that your idea, and you've talked about 25 million jobs created, 4 percent..."
576	0	Over a 10-year period.
577	0	growth is unrealistic.
578	0	And they say -- you talk a lot about growing the energy industry.
579	0	"They say with oil prices as low as they are right now, that's unrealistic, as well."
580	0	"Your response, sir?"
581	0	So I just left some high representatives of India.
582	0	They're growing at 8 percent.
583	0	China is growing at 7 percent.
584	0	And that for them is a catastrophically low number.
585	0	We are growing -- our last report came out -- and it's right around the 1 percent level.
586	0	And I think it's going down.
587	0	"Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report."
588	0	A terrible jobs report.
589	0	"In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the election?"
590	0	"Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad."
591	0	The report was so bad.
592	0	"Look, our country is stagnant."
593	0	We've lost our jobs.
594	0	We've lost our businesses.
595	0	"We're not making things anymore, relatively speaking."
596	0	"Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world."
597	0	I've visited so many communities.
598	0	"This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris."
599	0	I've gotten to know so many -- I've developed so many friends over the last year.
600	0	And they cry when they see what's happened.
601	0	"I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what's happened to these people in these communities."
602	0	"Now, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn't really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left."
603	0	"Boy, did they suffer."
604	0	That was one of the worst things that's ever been signed by our country.
605	0	Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership.
606	0	And she wants it.
607	1	She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates.
608	1	She totally lied.
609	1	She did call it the gold standard.
610	0	"And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right."
611	0	I was so honored.
612	0	"I want you to give you a chance to briefly speak to that, and then I want to pivot to one-sixth of the economy..."
613	0	And that will be as bad as NAFTA.
614	0	which is Obamacare.
615	0	"But go ahead, briefly."
616	1	"Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it."
617	0	It didn't meet my test.
618	0	I've had the same test.
619	0	"Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security?"
620	0	I'm against it now.
621	0	I'll be against it after the election.
622	0	I'll be against it when I'm president.
623	0	"There's only one of us on this stage who's actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that's Donald."
624	0	"He's shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico."
625	0	But he mentioned China.
626	0	"And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets."
627	0	I have fought against that as a senator.
628	0	I've stood up against it as secretary of state.
629	0	Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum.
630	0	"In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel."
631	0	"So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers."
632	0	Mr. Trump?
633	0	That's the kind of approach that is just not going to work.
634	0	"Well, let me just say -- let me just say."
635	0	We're going to pull the country together.
636	0	We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce.
637	0	That's why I'm going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history.
638	0	"And we're going to enforce those agreements, and we're going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products."
639	0	Secretary Clinton?
640	0	"Go ahead, Mr. Trump."
641	0	Let me ask a simple question.
642	0	She's been doing this for 30 years.
643	0	"Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years?"
644	0	"No, I voted."
645	0	You were very much involved -- excuse me.
646	0	My turn.
647	0	You were very much involved in every aspect of this country.
648	0	Very much.
649	0	And you do have experience.
650	0	"I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it's bad experience, because what you've done has turned out badly."
651	0	"For 30 years, you've been in a position to help, and if you say that I use steel or I use something else, I -- make it impossible for me to do that."
652	0	I wouldn't mind.
653	0	"The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary."
654	0	You don't.
655	1	"Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing."
656	1	How do you miss $6 billion?
657	1	"You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen."
658	0	They don't know.
659	1	"It's gone, $6 billion."
660	0	"If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess."
661	0	Believe me.
662	0	"Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times."
663	0	But I think it's really an important issue.
664	0	"He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that."
665	0	"You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund."
666	0	And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools.
667	0	He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.
668	0	"In the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas."
669	1	He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses.
670	0	"In the 1990s, I went to Beijing and I said women's rights are human rights."
671	0	"He insulted a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, called her an eating machine."
672	0	Give me a break.
673	0	"And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the ""Celebrity Apprentice."""
674	0	"So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I've done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I'll let the American people make that decision."
675	0	"Well, I think I did a much better job."
676	0	"I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars."
677	1	I started with a $1 million loan.
678	0	I agree with that.
679	1	It's a $1 million loan.
680	0	But I built a phenomenal company.
681	0	"And if we could run our country the way I've run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of."
682	0	You would even be proud of it.
683	0	"And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria."
684	0	Take a look at the migration.
685	0	Take a look at Libya.
686	0	Take a look at Iraq.
687	1	"She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when -- we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out."
688	1	She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there.
689	0	And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries.
690	0	And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS.
691	0	She's going to get rid of nobody.
692	0	All right.
693	0	"We are going to get to foreign hot spots in a few moments, but the next segment is fitness to be president of the United States."
694	0	"Mr. Trump, at the last debate, you said your talk about grabbing women was just that, talk, and that you'd never actually done it."
695	0	"And since then, as we all know, nine women have come forward and have said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent."
696	0	"Why would so many different women from so many different circumstances over so many different years, why would they all in this last couple of weeks make up -- you deny this -- why would they all make up these stories?"
697	0	"Since this is a question for both of you, Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump says what your husband did and that you defended was even worse."
698	0	"Mr. Trump, you go first."
699	1	"Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked."
700	0	Those people -- I don't know those people.
701	0	I have a feeling how they came.
702	0	I believe it was her campaign that did it.
703	0	Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence?
704	0	She's the one and Obama that caused the violence.
705	0	"They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things."
706	1	"I would say the only way -- because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that."
707	0	"And I didn't even apologize to my wife, who's sitting right here, because I didn't do anything."
708	1	I didn't know any of these -- I didn't see these women.
709	0	"These women -- the woman on the plane, the -- I think they want either fame or her campaign did it."
710	0	And I think it's her campaign.
711	0	"Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence."
712	0	"And I'll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot."
713	0	"And that was now all on tape, started by her."
714	0	"I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward."
715	0	"If it wasn't, they get their 10 minutes of fame."
716	0	But they were all totally -- it was all fiction.
717	0	"It was lies, and it was fiction."
718	0	Well...
719	0	Secretary Clinton?
720	0	"At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women."
721	0	"And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them."
722	0	"Now, what was his response?"
723	1	"Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted."
724	0	I did not say that.
725	0	I did not say that.
726	0	"In fact, he went on to say..."
727	0	"Her two minutes -- sir, her two minutes."
728	0	Her two minutes.
729	0	I did not say that.
730	0	It's her two minutes.
731	1	"He went on to say, ""Look at her."
732	1	"I don't think so."""
733	1	"About another woman, he said, ""That wouldn't be my first choice."""
734	0	"He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her ""disgusting,"" as he has called a number of women during this campaign."
735	0	Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.
736	0	"He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like."
737	0	So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women.
738	0	That's who Donald is.
739	0	"I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater."
740	0	"America is great, because America is good."
741	0	"And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren."
742	0	Mr. Trump...
743	0	Nobody has more respect for women than I do.
744	0	Nobody.
745	0	(LAUGHTER)
746	0	Nobody has more respect...
747	0	"Please, everybody."
748	1	"And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked."
749	0	And I really want to just talk about something slightly different.
750	0	"She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign."
751	1	"But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress."
752	0	"What happened to the FBI, I don't know."
753	0	"We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI."
754	0	One lie.
755	0	"She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI."
756	0	He's going to probably go to jail.
757	0	This is a four-star general.
758	0	"And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States?"
759	0	"That's really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign."
760	0	Secretary Clinton?
761	0	"Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility."
762	0	And it's not just about women.
763	0	He never apologizes or says he's sorry for anything.
764	0	So we know what he has said and what he's done to women.
765	0	"But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television."
766	0	Wrong.
767	0	"He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion."
768	0	"He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers ""people who aren't captured."""
769	0	"He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn't be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican."
770	0	So it's not one thing.
771	0	"This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies."
772	0	That is not who America is.
773	0	"And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election."
774	0	It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have.
775	0	"So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence."
776	0	It's on tape.
777	0	During the last...
778	0	"The other things are false, but honestly, I'd love to talk about getting rid of ISIS, and I'd love to talk about other things..."
779	0	OK.
780	0	"but those other charges, as she knows, are false."
781	0	"In this bucket about fitness to be president, there's been a lot of developments over the last 10 days since the last debate."
782	0	I'd like to ask you about them.
783	0	These are questions that the American people have.
784	0	"Secretary Clinton, during your 2009 Senate confirmation hearing, you promised to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest with your dealing with the Clinton Foundation while you were secretary of state, but e-mails show that donors got special access to you."
785	0	"Those seeking grants for Haiti relief were considered separately from non-donors, and some of those donors got contracts, government contracts, taxpayer money."
786	0	Can you really say that you kept your pledge to that Senate committee?
787	0	"And why isn't what happened and what went on between you and the Clinton Foundation, why isn't it what Mr. Trump calls pay to play?"
788	0	"Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values."
789	0	The State Department has said that.
790	0	I think that's been proven.
791	0	"But I am happy, in fact I'm thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation, because it is a world-renowned charity and I am so proud of the work that it does."
792	0	"You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate -- I know I don't have the time to do that."
793	0	"But just briefly, the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV-AIDS to afford treatment, and that's about half all the people in the world who are getting treatment."
794	0	In partnership with the American Health Association...
795	0	Secretary Clinton...
796	0	"we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches..."
797	0	"Secretary Clinton, respectfully, this is -- this is an open discussion."
798	0	"Well, it is an open discussion."
799	0	And you...
800	0	And the specific question went to pay for play.
801	0	Do you want to talk about that?
802	0	"Well, but there is no -- but there is no evidence -- but there is..."
803	0	(CROSSTALK)
804	0	I think that it's been very well...
805	0	Let's ask Mr. Trump.
806	0	There is a lot of evidence about the very good work...
807	0	It's been very well studied.
808	0	and the high rankings...
809	0	(CROSSTALK)
810	0	Please let me Mr. Trump speak.
811	0	"and it's a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it."
812	0	Please let Mr. Trump speak.
813	0	(CROSSTALK)
814	0	It's a criminal enterprise.
815	0	"Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries."
816	0	You talk about women and women's rights?
817	0	So these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings.
818	0	These are people that kill women and treat women horribly.
819	0	And yet you take their money.
820	0	"So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly?"
821	0	Why don't you give back the money?
822	0	I think it would be a great gesture.
823	0	Because she takes a tremendous amount of money.
824	0	And you take a look at the people of Haiti.
825	0	I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida.
826	0	"And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what's happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace."
827	0	"And you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it."
828	0	Secretary Clinton?
829	1	"Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent -- 90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country."
830	0	I'm very proud of that.
831	1	We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations.
832	0	"And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald."
833	0	"I mean, who does that?"
834	0	It just was astonishing.
835	0	"But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere."
836	0	"The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti."
837	0	Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years.
838	0	The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had.
839	0	"We have done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else."
840	0	And we're going to keep working to help Haiti...
841	0	All right.
842	0	because it's an important part of the American experience.
843	0	They don't want you to help them anymore.
844	0	(CROSSTALK)
845	0	I'd like to mention one thing.
846	0	"Trump Foundation, small foundation."
847	0	"People contribute, I contribute."
848	1	"The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military."
849	1	I don't get anything.
850	1	I don't buy boats.
851	1	I don't buy planes.
852	1	What happens -- the money goes to them.
853	1	"Wasn't some of the money used to settle your lawsuits, sir?"
854	1	"No, it was -- we put up the American flag."
855	0	And that's it.
856	0	They put up the American flag.
857	0	We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag.
858	0	Right.
859	1	"But there was a penalty that was imposed by Palm Beach County, and the money came from your foundation..."
860	0	There was.
861	0	There was.
862	0	"And, by the way..."
863	0	"instead of Mar-a-Lago or yourself, sir."
864	0	"the money -- the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses -- the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets."
865	0	I want to get into one...
866	0	"But, of course, there's no way we can know whether any of that is true, because he hasn't released his tax returns."
867	0	"He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can't prove it."
868	0	You can look at our tax returns.
869	0	We've got them all out there.
870	1	But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax.
871	0	"And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris."
872	0	"You know, half of all immigrants -- undocumented immigrants in our country -- actually pay federal income tax."
873	0	So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.
874	0	I find that just astonishing.
875	0	I want...
876	1	"So let me just tell you very quickly, we're entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it."
877	1	"And all of her donors -- just about all of them -- I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars..."
878	0	We...
879	0	Let me just explain.
880	0	"But, no, we heard this..."
881	0	Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do.
882	0	"Mr. Trump, we -- OK."
883	0	You know what she should have done?
884	0	"Folks, we heard this..."
885	0	"And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator..."
886	0	"Folks, we heard this..."
887	0	"because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so."
888	0	"Well, you know..."
889	0	You should have changed the law.
890	0	"But you won't change the law, because you take in so much money."
891	0	"I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump..."
892	0	Made with Chinese steel.
893	0	"But I will tell you, I sat there..."
894	0	(LAUGHTER)
895	0	"I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad."
896	0	All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you're going to protect them.
897	0	"And, frankly, you should have changed the laws."
898	0	Mr. Trump...
899	0	"If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws."
900	0	"Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about one last question in this topic."
901	0	You have been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you.
902	0	"Your running mate, Governor Pence, pledged on Sunday that he and you -- his words -- ""will absolutely accept the result of this election."""
903	0	"Today your daughter, Ivanka, said the same thing."
904	0	"I want to ask you here on the stage tonight: Do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely -- sir, that you will absolutely accept the result of this election?"
905	0	I will look at it at the time.
906	0	I'm not looking at anything now.
907	0	I'll look at it at the time.
908	0	What I've seen -- what I've seen is so bad.
909	0	"First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing."
910	0	"The New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don't even care."
911	0	It's so dishonest.
912	0	And they've poisoned the mind of the voters.
913	0	"But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it."
914	0	I think they're going to see through it.
915	0	We'll find out on November 8th.
916	0	But I think they're going to see through it.
917	0	"But, sir, there's..."
918	1	"If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions, this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote."
919	0	So let me just give you one other thing.
920	0	So I talk about the corrupt media.
921	0	I talk about the millions of people -- tell you one other thing.
922	0	She shouldn't be allowed to run.
923	0	"It's crooked -- she's -- she's guilty of a very, very serious crime."
924	0	She should not be allowed to run.
925	0	"And just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never..."
926	0	But...
927	0	"Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things."
928	0	"But, sir, there is a tradition in this country -- in fact, one of the prides of this country -- is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner."
929	0	"Not saying that you're necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country."
930	0	Are you saying you're not prepared now to commit to that principle?
931	0	What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time.
932	0	I'll keep you in suspense.
933	0	OK?
934	0	"Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying."
935	0	"You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him."
936	0	The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails.
937	0	They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged.
938	0	He lost the Iowa caucus.
939	0	He lost the Wisconsin primary.
940	0	He said the Republican primary was rigged against him.
941	0	Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him.
942	0	There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.
943	0	Should have gotten it.
944	0	(LAUGHTER)
945	0	This is -- this is a mindset.
946	0	This is how Donald thinks.
947	0	"And it's funny, but it's also really troubling."
948	0	OK.
949	0	So that is not the way our democracy works.
950	0	We've been around for 240 years.
951	0	We've had free and fair elections.
952	0	We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them.
953	0	And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election.
954	0	"You know, President Obama said the other day when you're whining before the game is even finished..."
955	0	(APPLAUSE)
956	0	Hold on.
957	0	"Hold on, folks."
958	0	"Hold on, folks."
959	0	it just shows you're not up to doing the job.
960	0	"And let's -- you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means."
961	0	He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy.
962	0	"And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position."
963	0	"I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it's disgraceful."
964	0	I think it's a disgrace.
965	0	All right.
966	0	I think we've never had a situation so bad in this country.
967	0	(APPLAUSE)
968	0	"Hold on, folks."
969	0	This doesn't do any good for anyone.
970	0	"Let's please continue the debate, and let's move on to the subject of foreign hot spots."
971	0	The Iraqi offensive to take back Mosul has begun.
972	0	"If they are successful in pushing ISIS out of that city and out of all of Iraq, the question then becomes, what happens the day after?"
973	0	And that's something that whichever of you ends up -- whoever of you ends up as president is going to have to confront.
974	0	Will you put U.S. troops into that vacuum to make sure that ISIS doesn't come back or isn't replaced by something even worse?
975	0	"Secretary Clinton, you go first in this segment."
976	0	You have two minutes.
977	0	"Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground."
978	0	But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force.
979	0	"I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do."
980	0	"In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself."
981	0	The goal here is to take back Mosul.
982	0	It's going to be a hard fight.
983	0	I've got no illusions about that.
984	0	"And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters."
985	0	I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation.
986	0	But we know we've got lots of work to do.
987	0	"Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue."
988	0	"So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS."
989	0	"That's why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don't let terrorists buy weapons."
990	0	"If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun."
991	0	"And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track."
992	0	"Mr. Trump, same question."
993	0	"If we are able to push ISIS out of Mosul and out of Iraq, will -- would you be willing to put U.S. troops in there to prevent their return or something else?"
994	0	"Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad."
995	0	We had Mosul.
996	0	"But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul."
997	0	Now we're fighting again to get Mosul.
998	0	The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul.
999	0	"About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they're going to attack Mosul."
1000	0	"Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK?"
1001	0	We announce we're going after Mosul.
1002	0	"I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about -- how long is it, Hillary, three months?"
1003	0	These people have all left.
1004	0	They've all left.
1005	0	The element of surprise.
1006	0	"Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country."
1007	0	"So we're now fighting for Mosul, that we had."
1008	0	"All she had to do was stay there, and now we're going in to get it."
1009	0	But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it?
1010	0	And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough.
1011	0	They want to look good.
1012	0	"He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes."
1013	0	That's why we have the great migration.
1014	0	But she wanted to look good for the election.
1015	0	So they're going in.
1016	0	"But who's going to get Mosul, really?"
1017	0	We'll take Mosul eventually.
1018	0	"But the way -- if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought."
1019	0	"Much, much tougher."
1020	0	Much more dangerous.
1021	0	Going to be more deaths that they thought.
1022	0	But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart.
1023	0	"They say, what do we need this for?"
1024	0	So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing.
1025	0	"And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid -- the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons."
1026	0	"Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them."
1027	0	So we're now going to take Mosul.
1028	0	And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary?
1029	0	Iran.
1030	0	"Oh, yeah, they're making -- I mean, they are outsmarting -- look, you're not there, you might be involved in that decision."
1031	0	But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq.
1032	0	"You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it."
1033	0	"You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way."
1034	0	"Sir, your two minutes are up."
1035	0	"The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran."
1036	0	"Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq."
1037	0	I said it was a mistake.
1038	0	I've said that years ago.
1039	0	He has consistently denied what is...
1040	0	Wrong.
1041	0	a very clear fact that...
1042	0	Wrong.
1043	1	"before the invasion, he supported it."
1044	0	"And, you know, I just want everybody to go Google it."
1045	0	"Google ""Donald Trump Iraq."""
1046	1	And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.
1047	0	Wrong.
1048	0	And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that.
1049	0	"Now, why does that matter?"
1050	0	"Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position."
1051	0	I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.
1052	0	But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay.
1053	0	Mosul is a Sunni city.
1054	0	Mosul is on the border of Syria.
1055	0	"And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and -- just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" and we brought him to justice."
1056	0	We need to go after the leadership.
1057	0	"But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters."
1058	0	There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul.
1059	0	They've been digging underground.
1060	0	They've been prepared to defend.
1061	0	It's going to be tough fighting.
1062	0	"But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa."
1063	0	This is what we have to do.
1064	0	"I'm just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that's how Donald thinks."
1065	0	"You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy."
1066	0	"Chris, we don't gain anything."
1067	0	He has all the conspiracy theories...
1068	0	(CROSSTALK)
1069	0	Iran is taking over Iraq.
1070	0	"Secretary Clinton, it's..."
1071	0	(CROSSTALK)
1072	0	Iran is taking over Iraq.
1073	0	We don't gain anything.
1074	0	"This conspiracy theory, which he's been spewing out for quite some time."
1075	0	If they did it by surprise...
1076	0	(CROSSTALK)
1077	0	"Wait, wait, wait, Secretary Clinton, it's an open discussion."
1078	0	He says...
1079	0	(CROSSTALK)
1080	0	We could have gained if they did it by surprise.
1081	0	"Secretary, please let Mr. Trump speak."
1082	0	"unfit, and he proves it every time he talks."
1083	0	"No, you are the one that's unfit."
1084	0	"You know, WikiLeaks just actually came out -- John Podesta said some horrible things about you, and, boy, was he right."
1085	0	He said some beauties.
1086	0	"And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment."
1087	0	You do.
1088	0	"And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone."
1089	0	"If you think that was good, then you do."
1090	0	"Now, John Podesta said you have terrible instincts."
1091	0	Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment.
1092	0	I agree with both.
1093	0	"Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president."
1094	0	And he has said...
1095	0	Which is a big mistake.
1096	0	"as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America."
1097	0	I think he's right.
1098	0	Let's turn to Aleppo.
1099	0	"Mr. Trump, in the last debate, you were both asked about the situation in the Syrian city of Aleppo."
1100	0	"And I want to follow up on that, because you said several things in that debate which were not true, sir."
1101	0	You said that Aleppo has basically fallen.
1102	0	"In fact, there -- in fact, there are..."
1103	0	It's a catastrophe.
1104	0	I mean...
1105	0	"It's a catastrophe, but there..."
1106	0	it's a mess.
1107	0	There are a quarter of...
1108	0	Have you seen it?
1109	0	Have you seen it?
1110	0	Sir...
1111	0	Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo?
1112	0	"Sir, if I may finish my question..."
1113	0	"OK, so it hasn't fallen."
1114	0	Take a look at it.
1115	0	"Well, there are a quarter of a million people still living there and being slaughtered."
1116	0	That's right.
1117	0	And they are being slaughtered...
1118	0	Yes.
1119	0	because of bad decisions.
1120	0	"If I may just finish here, and you also said that -- that Syria and Russia are busy fighting ISIS."
1121	0	"In fact, they have been the ones who've been bombing and shelling eastern Aleppo, and they just announced a humanitarian pause, in effect, admitting that they have been bombing and shelling Aleppo."
1122	0	"Would you like to clear that up, sir?"
1123	0	"Well, Aleppo is a disaster."
1124	0	It's a humanitarian nightmare.
1125	0	But it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint.
1126	0	"I mean, what do you need, a signed document?"
1127	0	Take a look at Aleppo.
1128	0	It is so sad when you see what's happened.
1129	0	"And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's -- he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama."
1130	0	"And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago."
1131	0	He -- he aligned with Russia.
1132	0	"He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful."
1133	0	We gave them $150 billion back.
1134	0	We give them $1.7 billion in cash.
1135	0	"I mean, cash."
1136	0	Bundles of cash as big as this stage.
1137	0	We gave them $1.7 billion.
1138	0	Now they have -- he has aligned with Russia and with Iran.
1139	0	"They don't want ISIS, but they have other things, because we're backing -- we're backing rebels."
1140	0	We don't know who the rebels are.
1141	0	"We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything."
1142	0	We don't know who the rebels are.
1143	0	"And when and if -- and it's not going to happen, because you have Russia and you have Iran now."
1144	0	"But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with -- as bad as Assad is, and he's a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad."
1145	0	"If she did nothing, we'd be in much better shape."
1146	0	"And this is what's caused the great migration, where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases -- not probably, who are definitely..."
1147	0	Let me...
1148	0	"in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see -- this is going to be the great Trojan horse."
1149	0	And wait until you see what happens in the coming years.
1150	0	"Lots of luck, Hillary."
1151	0	Thanks a lot for doing a great job.
1152	0	"Secretary Clinton, you have talked about -- and in the last debate and again today -- that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there."
1153	0	President Obama has refused to do that because he fears it's going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict.
1154	0	"And General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says you impose a no-fly zone, chances are you're going to get into a war -- his words -- with Syria and Russia."
1155	0	"So the question I have is, if you impose a no-fly zone -- first of all, how do you respond to their concerns?"
1156	0	"Secondly, if you impose a no-fly zone and a Russian plane violates that, does President Clinton shoot that plane down?"
1157	0	"Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict."
1158	0	I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.
1159	0	This would not be done just on the first day.
1160	0	This would take a lot of negotiation.
1161	0	And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.
1162	0	We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated.
1163	0	"So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS."
1164	0	But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees.
1165	0	He's made these claims repeatedly.
1166	0	"I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in."
1167	0	But I am not going to slam the door on women and children.
1168	0	"That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting."
1169	0	"And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting."
1170	0	"That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks."
1171	0	"In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born."
1172	0	So let's be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.
1173	0	"And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we've got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home."
1174	0	"Folks, I want to get into our final segment."
1175	0	But I just have to...
1176	0	Real quick.
1177	0	It's so ridiculous what she -- she will defeat ISIS.
1178	0	We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place.
1179	0	"And right now, they're in 32 countries."
1180	0	OK.
1181	0	We should have -- wait one second.
1182	0	They had a cease-fire three weeks ago.
1183	0	"A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria."
1184	0	"And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore."
1185	0	"We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires."
1186	0	They are outplayed.
1187	0	"Now, she wasn't there."
1188	0	I assume she had nothing to do with it.
1189	0	"But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way -- and by Iran."
1190	0	Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is.
1191	0	"Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton -- no, we need to move on to our final segment, and that is the national debt, which has not been discussed until tonight."
1192	0	"Our national debt, as a share of the economy, our GDP, is now 77 percent."
1193	0	That's the highest since just after World War II.
1194	0	"But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says, Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86 percent of GDP over the next 10 years."
1195	0	"Mr. Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105 percent of GDP over the next 10 years."
1196	0	"The question is, why are both of you ignoring this problem?"
1197	0	"Mr. Trump, you go first."
1198	0	"Well, I say they're wrong, because I'm going to create tremendous jobs."
1199	0	"And we're bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero."
1200	0	But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent.
1201	0	And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent.
1202	0	I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent.
1203	0	"And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine."
1204	0	We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again.
1205	0	"To do that, we're taking back jobs."
1206	0	"We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don't make our product anymore."
1207	0	It's very sad.
1208	0	But I'm going to create a -- the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry.
1209	0	We used to be there.
1210	0	We've given it up.
1211	0	"We've become very, very sloppy."
1212	0	"We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies."
1213	0	"You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don't use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say."
1214	0	But we don't use those people.
1215	0	Those are the people -- these are the greatest negotiators in the world.
1216	0	We have the greatest businesspeople in the world.
1217	0	We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.
1218	0	We use political hacks.
1219	0	We use people that get the position because they gave -- they made a campaign contribution and they're dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are.
1220	0	So we have to use our great people.
1221	0	"But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades."
1222	0	"And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money."
1223	0	And we'll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new.
1224	0	Secretary Clinton?
1225	0	"Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is ""Make America Great Again,"" I wonder when he thought America was great."
1226	0	"And before he rushes and says, ""You know, before you and President Obama were there,"" I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades."
1227	0	"You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world."
1228	0	He was criticizing President Reagan.
1229	0	"This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, ""You know, I alone can fix it,"" as he said on the convention stage."
1230	0	"But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I'm proposing."
1231	0	I do not add a penny to the national debt.
1232	0	"I take that very seriously, because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with."
1233	0	"So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I've made it very clear we are going where the money is."
1234	0	We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.
1235	0	And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth.
1236	0	"In fact, I think just the opposite."
1237	0	We'll have what economists call middle-out growth.
1238	0	"We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America."
1239	0	That's where growth will come from.
1240	0	That's why I want to invest in you.
1241	0	I want to invest in your family.
1242	0	"And I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer."
1243	0	And we just have a big disagreement about this.
1244	0	It may be because of our experiences.
1245	0	"You know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire..."
1246	0	"Yeah, yeah, we've heard -- we've heard this before, Hillary."
1247	0	I started off with -- my dad was a small-business man.
1248	0	We've heard this before.
1249	0	"And I think it -- you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy."
1250	0	Time.
1251	0	"Thank you, Hillary."
1252	0	Could I just respond?
1253	0	"Well, no, sir, because we're running out of time..."
1254	0	Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade.
1255	0	I disagreed with him.
1256	0	We should have been much tougher on trade even then.
1257	0	I've been waiting for years.
1258	0	Nobody does it right.
1259	0	OK.
1260	0	"And frankly, now we're going to do it right."
1261	0	All right.
1262	0	"The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60 percent of all federal spending."
1263	0	"Now, the Committee for federal -- a Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare's going to run out of money in the 2020s, Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits."
1264	0	"So, in effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is -- and let me start with you, Mr. Trump, would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements?"
1265	0	I'm cutting taxes.
1266	0	We're going to grow the economy.
1267	0	It's going to grow at a record rate of growth.
1268	0	That's not going to help in the entitlements.
1269	0	"No, it's going to totally help you."
1270	0	And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.
1271	0	It's destroying our country.
1272	0	"It's destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses."
1273	0	We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.
1274	0	"You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster."
1275	0	"If we don't repeal and replace -- now, it's probably going to die of its own weight."
1276	0	But Obamacare has to go.
1277	1	"It's -- the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent."
1278	1	Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent.
1279	0	"And I'm really glad that the premiums have started -- at least the people see what's happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can't get any worse."
1280	0	Bad health care at the most expensive price.
1281	0	We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.
1282	0	"And, Secretary Clinton, same question, because at this point, Social Security and Medicare are going to run out, the trust funds are going to run out of money."
1283	0	"Will you as president entertain -- will you consider a grand bargain, a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs?"
1284	0	"Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund."
1285	0	That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy.
1286	0	"My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it."
1287	0	But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund...
1288	0	Such a nasty woman.
1289	0	"by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it."
1290	0	I will not cut benefits.
1291	0	I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.
1292	0	But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt.
1293	0	That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.
1294	0	"And I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal."
1295	0	The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund.
1296	0	"So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse."
1297	0	What we need to do is go after...
1298	0	Your husband disagrees with you.
1299	0	the long-term health care drivers.
1300	0	"We've got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness."
1301	0	I have a plan for doing that.
1302	0	And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.
1303	0	"This is -- this is the final time, probably to both of your delight, that you're going to be on a stage together in this campaign."
1304	0	I would like to end it on a positive note.
1305	0	"You had not agreed to closing statements, but it seems to me in a funny way that might make it more interesting because you haven't prepared closing statements."
1306	0	"So I'd like you each to take -- and we're going to put a clock up, a minute, as the final question in the final debate, to tell the American people why they should elect you to be the next president."
1307	0	This is another new mini-segment.
1308	0	"Secretary Clinton, it's your turn to go first."
1309	0	"Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone."
1310	0	"We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition."
1311	0	"You know, I've been privileged to see the presidency up close."
1312	0	And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you.
1313	0	I have made the cause of children and families really my life's work.
1314	0	That's what my mission will be in the presidency.
1315	0	"I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations."
1316	0	"I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college."
1317	0	I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president.
1318	0	"Secretary Clinton, thank you."
1319	0	Mr. Trump?
1320	0	She's raising the money from the people she wants to control.
1321	0	Doesn't work that way.
1322	0	"But when I started this campaign, I started it very strongly."
1323	0	"It's called ""Make America Great Again."""
1324	0	We're going to make America great.
1325	0	We have a depleted military.
1326	0	"It has to be helped, has to be fixed."
1327	0	We have the greatest people on Earth in our military.
1328	0	We don't take care of our veterans.
1329	1	"We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets."
1330	0	That can't happen.
1331	0	Our policemen and women are disrespected.
1332	0	"We need law and order, but we need justice, too."
1333	0	Our inner cities are a disaster.
1334	0	You get shot walking to the store.
1335	0	They have no education.
1336	0	They have no jobs.
1337	0	I will do more for African-Americans and Latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes.
1338	0	"All she's done is talk to the African-Americans and to the Latinos, but they get the vote, and then they come back, they say, we'll see you in four years."
1339	0	"We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now."
1340	0	"We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her."
1341	0	Thank you both.
1342	0	(APPLAUSE)
1343	0	"Secretary Clinton -- hold on just a moment, folks."
1344	0	"Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, I want to thank you both for participating in all three of these debates."
1345	0	That brings to an end this year's debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.
1346	0	"We want to thank the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and its students for having us."
1347	0	Now the decision is up to you.
1348	0	"While millions have already voted, Election Day, November 8th, is just 20 days away."
1349	0	One thing everyone here can agree on: We hope you will go vote.
1350	0	It is one of the honors and obligations of living in this great country.
1351	0	"Thank you, and good night."
1	0	Thank you very much.
2	0	I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for Secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr.
3	0	Alex Acosta.
4	0	"He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student."
5	0	Former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito.
6	0	And he has had a tremendous career.
7	0	"He’s a member, and has been a member, of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed — did very, very well."
8	0	"And so Alex, I’ve wished him the best."
9	0	We just spoke.
10	0	And he’s going to be — I think he’ll be a tremendous Secretary of Labor.
11	0	"And also, as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved — weeks late, I have to say that."
12	0	"Weeks, weeks late."
13	0	Office of Management and Budget.
14	0	"And he will be, I think, a fantastic addition."
15	0	Paul Singer has just left.
16	0	"As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump, or, as they say, ""Never Trump."" And Paul just left and he’s given us his total support."
17	0	And it’s all about unification.
18	0	"We’re unifying the party, and hopefully we’re going to be able to unify the country."
19	0	It’s very important to me.
20	0	"I’ve been talking about that for a long time, but it’s very, very important to me."
21	0	So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office.
22	0	"He was a very strong opponent, and now he’s a very strong ally."
23	0	And I appreciate that.
24	0	"I think I’ll say a few words, and then we’ll take some questions."
25	0	"And I had this time — we’ve been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible."
26	0	Just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening.
27	0	And we’ve done some really good work.
28	0	We’re very proud of that.
29	0	"And then right after that, you prepare yourselves and we’ll do some questions — unless you have no questions."
30	0	That’s always a possibility.
31	0	I’m here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration.
32	0	We have made incredible progress.
33	0	"I don’t think there’s ever been a President elected who, in this short period of time, has done what we’ve done."
34	0	"A new Rasmussen poll, in fact — because the people get it; much of the media doesn’t get it."
35	0	"They actually get it, but they don’t write it — let’s put it that way."
36	0	"But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up."
37	0	"The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know."
38	0	"And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is — to me means something much different than it used to."
39	0	"It used to mean, oh, that’s good."
40	0	Now it means that’s good for jobs.
41	0	Very different.
42	0	"Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States and big league — Ford, General Motors, so many of them."
43	0	"I’m making this presentation directly to the American people with the media present, which is an honor to have you this morning, because many of our nation’s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve."
44	0	"And I hope going forward we can be a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that’s possible."
45	0	"Maybe it’s not, and that’s okay too."
46	0	"Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles, in particular, speaks not for the people but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system."
47	0	"The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people — tremendous disservice."
48	0	"We have to talk about it to find out what’s going on, because the press honestly is out of control."
49	0	The level of dishonesty is out of control.
50	0	I ran for President to represent the citizens of our country.
51	0	I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well.
52	0	"I am talking, and really talking, on this very entrenched power structure, and what we’re doing is we’re talking about the power structure, we’re talking about its entrenchment."
53	0	"As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort — not all the time — and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say; they’re honest and fantastic."
54	0	But much of it is not — the distortion.
55	0	"And we’ll talk about it, and you’ll be able to ask me questions about it."
56	0	"But we’re not going to let it happen, because I’m here again to take my message straight to the people."
57	0	"As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy."
58	0	"To be honest, I inherited a mess — it’s a mess — at home and abroad."
59	0	A mess.
60	1	Jobs are pouring out of the country.
61	0	"You see what’s going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places — low-pay, low-wages."
62	0	"Mass instability overseas, no matter where you look."
63	0	"The Middle East, a disaster."
64	0	"North Korea — we’ll take care of it, folks."
65	0	We’re going to take care of it all.
66	0	I just want to let you know I inherited a mess.
67	0	"Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges."
68	0	"On foreign affairs, we’ve already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders — much of it you’ve covered — to move forward toward stability, security, and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many."
69	0	"We’ve had great conversations with the United Kingdom — and meetings — Israel, Mexico, Japan, China, and Canada."
70	0	"Really, really productive conversations."
71	0	I would say far more productive than you would understand.
72	0	We’ve even developed a new council with Canada to promote women’s business leaders and entrepreneurs.
73	0	"It’s very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka."
74	0	"I have directed our defense community, headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis — he’s over there now, working very hard — to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world."
75	0	"It used to be a small group, and now it’s in large sections of the world."
76	0	They’ve spread like cancer.
77	0	ISIS has spread like cancer.
78	0	Another mess I inherited.
79	0	"And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, who’s totally taken advantage of our previous administration."
80	0	And they’re the world’s top sponsor of terrorism.
81	0	And we’re not going to stop until that problem is properly solved.
82	0	And it’s not properly solved now.
83	0	It’s one of the worst agreements I’ve ever seen drawn by anybody.
84	0	I’ve ordered plans to begin for the massive rebuilding of the United States military.
85	0	I’ve had great support from the Senate.
86	0	I’ve had great support from Congress generally.
87	0	We’ve pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military.
88	0	And I will tell you that is my — I would be so happy if we never had to use it.
89	0	But our country will never have had a military like the military we’re about to build and rebuild.
90	0	"We have the greatest people on Earth in our military, but they don’t have the right equipment."
91	0	And their equipment is old.
92	0	"I used it, I talked about it at every stop."
93	0	Depleted — it’s depleted.
94	0	It won’t be depleted for long.
95	0	"And I think one of the reasons I’m standing here instead of other people is that, frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military."
96	0	We have to have strong law enforcement also.
97	0	So we do not go abroad in the search of war.
98	0	"We really are searching for peace, but it’s peace through strength."
99	0	"At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years."
100	0	"In each of these actions, I’m keeping my promises to the American people."
101	0	These are campaign promises.
102	0	Some people are so surprised that we’re having strong borders.
103	0	"Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about for a year and a half — strong borders."
104	0	"They’re so surprised — ""oh, you’re having strong borders."""
105	0	One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected.
106	0	"Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about to the press and to everybody else."
107	0	They lie to the American people in order to get elected.
108	0	"Some of the things I’m doing probably aren’t popular, but they’re necessary for security and for other reasons."
109	0	"And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests, which is more important to many politicians."
110	0	I’m here following through on what I pledged to do.
111	0	That’s all I’m doing.
112	0	I put it out before the American people.
113	1	Got 306 Electoral College votes.
114	0	I wasn’t supposed to get 222.
115	0	They said there’s no way to get 222; 230 is impossible.
116	0	"Two hundred and seventy, which you need, that was laughable."
117	0	We got 306 because people came out and voted like they’ve never seen before.
118	0	So that’s the way it goes.
119	1	I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan.
120	0	"In other words, the media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made, and they’re not happy about it for whatever reason."
121	0	But a lot of people are happy about it.
122	0	"In fact, I’ll be in Melbourne, Florida, five o’clock on Saturday, and I heard — just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there."
123	0	"I turn on the TV, open the newspapers, and I see stories of chaos."
124	0	Chaos!
125	0	"Yet, it is the exact opposite."
126	0	"This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can’t get my Cabinet approved, and they’re outstanding people."
127	0	Like Senator Dan Coates whose there — one of the most respected men of the Senate — he can’t get approved.
128	0	How do you not approve him?
129	0	"He’s been a colleague, highly respected — brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it — but waiting for approval."
130	0	"So we have a wonderful group of people that’s working very hard, that’s being very much misrepresented about, and we can’t let that happen."
131	0	"So if the Democrats, who have — all you have to do is look at where they are right now — the only thing they can do is delay, because they’ve screwed things up royally, believe me."
132	0	Let me list to you some of the things that we’ve done in just a short period of time.
133	0	I just got here.
134	0	I got here with no Cabinet.
135	0	"Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people."
136	0	"So we’ll go over just some of them, and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks coming."
137	0	We’ve withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans-Pacific Partnership.
138	0	"We’re going to make trade deals, but we’re going to have one-on-one deals — bilateral."
139	0	We’re going to have one-on-one deals.
140	0	"We’ve directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing, and called for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure, and that means plants, equipment, roads, bridges, factories."
141	0	"People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory."
142	0	"They go in for a permit — it’s many, many years."
143	0	"And then at the end of the process — they spend tens of millions of dollars on nonsense — and at the end of the process, they get rejected."
144	0	"Now, they may be rejected with me, but it’s going to be a quick rejection."
145	0	It’s not going to take years.
146	0	"But mostly, it’s going to be an acceptance."
147	0	"We want plants built, and we want factories built, and we want the jobs."
148	0	We don’t want the jobs going to other countries.
149	0	We’ve imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers.
150	0	We’ve imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations.
151	0	"We’ve issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated."
152	0	Makes sense.
153	0	Nobody has ever seen regulations like we have.
154	0	"If you go to other countries and you look at industries they have, and you say, let me see your regulations, and they’re a fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have."
155	0	"And I want regulations because I want safety, I want all environmental situations to be taken properly care of."
156	0	It’s very important to me.
157	0	But you don’t need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.
158	0	"We’ve stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence."
159	0	"We’ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation — take a look at Chicago and others — taking place right now in our inner cities."
160	0	Horrible.
161	0	We’ve ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs.
162	0	We’re becoming a drug-infested nation.
163	0	"Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars, and we’re not going to let it happen any longer."
164	0	"We’ve undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe, and are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border."
165	0	"Met with General, now Secretary, Kelly yesterday and we’re starting that process."
166	0	"And the wall is going to be a great wall, and it’s going to be a wall negotiated by me."
167	0	"The price is going to come down, just like it has on everything else I’ve negotiated for the government."
168	0	And we’re going to have a wall that works.
169	0	"We’re not going to have a wall like they have now, which is either nonexistent or a joke."
170	0	"We’ve ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we’ve ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border."
171	0	"No more release, no matter who you are — release."
172	0	"We’ve begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers, and others who pose a threat to public safety."
173	0	We are saving American lives every single day.
174	0	The court system has not made it easy for us.
175	0	"And we’ve even created a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, of which there are many."
176	0	We’ve taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country.
177	0	"Though parts of our necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by a judge’s, in my opinion, incorrect and unsafe ruling, our administration is working night and day to keep you safe — including reporters safe — and is vigorously defending this lawful order."
178	0	I will not back down from defending our country.
179	0	I got elected on defense of our country.
180	0	And I keep my campaign promises.
181	0	And our citizens will be very happy when they see the result.
182	0	They already are.
183	0	I can tell you that.
184	0	"Extreme vetting will be put in place, and it already is in place in many places."
185	1	"In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number."
186	0	I’ve heard 80 percent — I find that hard to believe; that’s just a number I heard — that they’re overturned 80 percent of the time.
187	0	"I think that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is, frankly, in turmoil."
188	0	But we are appealing that and we are going further.
189	0	"We’re issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country, so we’ll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that."
190	0	"At the same time, we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people, and that will be done some time next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part."
191	0	"We’ve also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines — thousands and thousands of jobs — and put new ""Buy American"" measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines."
192	0	"In other words, they build a pipeline in this country and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen."
193	0	We want them to use American steel.
194	0	"And they’re willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along."
195	0	Even this order was drawn and they didn’t say that.
196	0	"And I’m reading the order, I’m saying, why aren’t we using American steel?"
197	0	"And they said, that’s a good idea."
198	0	We put it in.
199	0	"To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C."
200	0	I’ve started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.
201	0	We’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare.
202	0	"Obamacare is a disaster, folks."
203	0	It’s a disaster.
204	0	"You can say, oh, Obamacare — I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they’re not the Republican people that our representatives are representing."
205	0	So we’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back.
206	0	We’re bringing our jobs back to this country big league.
207	0	"It’s already happening, but big league."
208	0	I’ve also worked to install a Cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats.
209	0	You’ve seen what they’ve done over the last long number of years.
210	0	That will be one of the great Cabinets ever assembled in American history.
211	0	You look at Rex Tillerson — he’s out there negotiating right now.
212	0	"General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly."
213	0	"We have great, great people."
214	0	Mick is with us now.
215	0	We have great people.
216	0	Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens.
217	0	"Now, look, fair trade — not free — fair."
218	0	"If a country is taking advantage of us, we’re not going to let that happen anymore."
219	0	"Every country takes advantage of us, almost."
220	0	I may be able to find a couple that don’t.
221	0	"But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do."
222	0	Jobs have already started to surge.
223	1	"Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs."
224	1	"Fiat-Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs."
225	0	They were with me a week ago.
226	0	You know — you were here.
227	0	"General Motors, likewise, committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave."
228	0	"And if I didn’t get elected, believe me, they would have left."
229	0	And these jobs and these things that I’m announcing would never have come here.
230	1	Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with.
231	1	"And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs."
232	1	"Walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives."
233	0	"There will be many, many more."
234	0	Many more.
235	0	These are a few that we’re naming.
236	0	"Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades — decades and decades and decades, folks."
237	0	And we’re not going to let that happen anymore.
238	0	Not going to let it happen.
239	0	And one more thing.
240	0	"I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution — highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats — you may not see that, but he’ll get there one way or the other."
241	0	"But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes."
242	0	This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country.
243	0	"Again, I say it — there has never been a presidency that’s done so much in such a short period of time."
244	0	And we haven’t even started the big work that starts early next week.
245	0	Some very big things are going to be announced next week.
246	0	So we’re just getting started.
247	0	"We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p.m."
248	0	I hope to see you there.
249	0	"And with that, I’d just say, God bless America, and let’s take some questions."
250	0	Mara.
251	0	"Mara, go ahead."
252	0	You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.
253	0	Did you fire Mike Flynn?
254	0	"Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation."
255	0	He respectfully gave it.
256	0	"He is a man who — there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today."
257	0	And I was not happy with the way that information was given.
258	0	"He didn’t have to do that, because what he did wasn’t wrong, what he did in terms of the information he saw."
259	0	"What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally."
260	0	That’s the real problem.
261	0	"And you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a fake news, fabricated deal to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats, and the press plays right into it."
262	0	"In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this — they know nothing about it."
263	0	"They weren’t in Russia, they never made a phone call to Russia, they never received a phone call."
264	0	It’s all fake news.
265	0	It’s all fake news.
266	0	"The nice thing is I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal, Mara — and I think it’s very important — the illegal giving out classified information."
267	0	"And let me just tell you, it was given out, like, so much."
268	0	I’ll give you an example.
269	0	"I called, as you know, Mexico."
270	0	"It was a very confidential, classified call, but I called Mexico."
271	0	"And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well, that’s — I spoke to the President of Mexico, had a good call."
272	0	All of a sudden it’s out for the world to see.
273	0	It’s supposed to be secret.
274	0	It’s supposed to be either confidential or classified in that case.
275	0	Same thing with Australia.
276	0	All of a sudden people are finding out exactly what took place.
277	0	The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn.
278	0	"Everybody saw this, and I’m saying — the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is, how does the press get this information that’s classified?"
279	0	How do they do it?
280	0	You know why?
281	0	"Because it’s an illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves."
282	0	"But, more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves."
283	0	Really ashamed.
284	0	"Yes, go ahead."
285	0	Why did you keep your Vice President in the dark for almost two weeks?
286	0	"Because when I looked at the information, I said, I don’t think he did anything wrong."
287	0	"If anything, he did something right."
288	0	"He was coming into office, he looked at the information."
289	0	"He said, huh, that’s fine, that’s what they’re supposed to do."
290	0	They’re supposed to be — and he didn’t just call Russia.
291	0	"He called and spoke to, both ways — I think there were 30-some-odd countries."
292	0	He’s doing the job.
293	0	"You know, he was just doing his job."
294	0	"The thing is he didn’t tell our Vice President properly, and then he said he didn’t remember."
295	0	"So either way, it wasn’t very satisfactory to me."
296	0	"And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position, and that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision."
297	0	"But he didn’t tell the Vice President of the United States the facts, and then he didn’t remember."
298	0	And that just wasn’t acceptable to me.
299	0	Yes.
300	0	"President Trump, since you brought up Russia, I’m looking for some clarification here."
301	0	"During the campaign, did anyone from your team communicate with members of the Russian government or Russian intelligence?"
302	0	"And if so, what was the nature of those conversations?"
303	0	"Well, the failing New York Times wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday."
304	0	"And it was very much discredited, as you know."
305	0	It was — it’s a joke.
306	0	And the people mentioned in the story — I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia.
307	0	"They weren’t even a part, really — I mean, they were such a minor part — I hadn’t spoken to them."
308	0	"I think the one person, I don’t think I’ve ever spoken to him."
309	0	I don’t think I’ve ever met him.
310	0	"And he actually said he was a very low-level member of, I think, a committee for a short period of time."
311	0	I don’t think I ever met him.
312	0	"Now, it’s possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don’t think I ever met him."
313	0	"I didn’t talk to him, ever."
314	0	And he thought it was a joke.
315	0	"The other person said he never spoke to Russia, never received a call."
316	0	"Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera."
317	0	"And the other person, people knew that he’d represented various countries, but I don’t think he represented Russia — but knew that he represented various countries."
318	0	That’s what he does.
319	0	"I mean, people know that."
320	0	"That’s Mr. Manafort, who’s, by the way — who’s, by the way, a respected man."
321	0	He’s a respected man.
322	0	"But I think he represented the Ukraine, or Ukraine government, or somebody."
323	0	But everybody — people knew that.
324	0	Everybody knew that.
325	0	So these people — and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia.
326	0	And he said that very forcefully.
327	0	I saw his statement.
328	0	He said it very forcefully.
329	0	Most of the papers don’t print it because that’s not good for their stories.
330	0	So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it.
331	0	"And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia."
332	0	I have no loans in Russia.
333	0	I don’t have any deals in Russia.
334	0	President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election.
335	0	"He then called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific."
336	0	But so did many other leaders — almost all other leaders from almost all other countries.
337	0	So that’s the extent.
338	0	Russia is fake news.
339	0	Russia — this is fake news put out by the media.
340	0	"The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they’re there — because we have our new people going in place right now."
341	0	"As you know, Mike Pompeo is now taking control of the CIA."
342	0	James Comey at FBI.
343	0	Dan Coats is waiting to be approved.
344	0	"I mean, he is a senator, and a highly respected one."
345	0	And he’s still waiting to be approved.
346	0	But our new people are going in.
347	0	"And just while you’re at, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New Times’s story yesterday."
348	0	"And it talked about — you saw it, front page."
349	0	"So, Director of National Intelligence just put out — acting — a statement: ""Any suggestion that the United States intelligence community"" — this was just given to us — ""is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the President and his national security team is not true."""
350	0	So they took this front-page story out of The Wall Street Journal — top — and they just wrote the story is not true.
351	0	"And I’ll tell you something, I’ll be honest — because I sort of enjoy this back and forth, and I guess I have all my life, but I’ve never seen more dishonest media than, frankly, the political media."
352	0	"I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest."
353	0	But I will say that I never get phone calls from the media.
354	0	How do they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me?
355	0	"Or how do they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page?"
356	0	That was like that story they wrote about the women and me — front page.
357	0	Big massive story.
358	0	And it was nasty.
359	0	And then they called.
360	0	"They said, ""We never said that. We like Mr. Trump."""
361	0	They called up my office — we like Mr. Trump; we never said that.
362	0	"And it was totally — they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you — totally misrepresented."
363	0	"I said, give us a retraction."
364	0	They never gave us a retraction.
365	0	"And, frankly, I then went on to other things."
366	0	Go ahead.
367	0	Mr. President —
368	0	You okay?
369	0	I am.
370	0	Just wanted to get untangled.
371	0	"Very simply, you said today that you had the biggest electoral margins since Ronald Reagan with 304 or 306 electoral votes."
372	0	"In fact, President Obama got 365 in 2008."
373	0	"Well, I’m talking about Republican."
374	0	Yes.
375	0	"President Obama, 332."
376	0	George H.W.
377	0	"Bush, 426 when he won as President."
378	0	So why should Americans trust —
379	0	"Well, no, I was told — I was given that information."
380	0	I don’t know.
381	0	I was just given.
382	0	"We had a very, very big margin."
383	0	"I guess my question is, why should Americans trust you when you have accused the information they receive of being fake when you’re providing information that’s fake?"
384	0	"Well, I don’t know."
385	0	I was given that information.
386	0	"I was given — actually, I’ve seen that information around."
387	0	But it was a very substantial victory.
388	0	Do you agree with that?
389	0	You’re the President.
390	0	"Okay, thank you."
391	0	That’s a good answer.
392	0	Yes.
393	0	"Mr. President, thank you so much."
394	0	"Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn — there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed?"
395	0	"Did you have the transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly Ambassador Kislyak, who he was communicating with?"
396	0	What evidence did you weigh to determine there was no wrong doing?
397	0	"And further than that, sir, you’ve said on a couple of occasions this morning that you were going to aggressively pursue the sources of these leaks."
398	0	We are.
399	0	Can we ask what you’re doing to do?
400	0	"And also, we’ve heard about a review of the intelligence community headed by Stephen Feinberg."
401	0	What can you tell us about that?
402	0	"Well, first of all, about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon Mike Pompeo and James Comey, and they’re in position."
403	0	So I hope that we’ll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else.
404	0	"The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man."
405	0	"And he has offered his services, and it’s something we may take advantage of."
406	0	But I don’t think we’ll need that at all because of the fact that I think that we’re going to be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.
407	0	"As far as the general is concerned, when I first heard about it, I said, huh, that doesn’t sound wrong."
408	0	"My counsel came — Don McGahn, White House Counsel — and he told me, and I asked him, and he can speak very well for himself."
409	0	He said he doesn’t think anything is wrong.
410	0	"He really didn’t think — it was really what happened after that, but he didn’t think anything was done wrong."
411	0	"I didn’t either, because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it."
412	0	"I said, well, I don’t see — to me, he was doing the job."
413	0	"The information was provided by — who I don’t know — Sally Yates — and I was a little surprised because I said, doesn’t sound like he did anything wrong there."
414	0	"But he did something wrong with respect to the Vice President, and I thought that was not acceptable."
415	0	"As far as the actual making the call — in fact, I’ve watched various programs and I’ve read various articles where he was just doing his job."
416	0	That was very normal.
417	0	"At first, everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong."
418	0	"After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job."
419	0	"So — and I do — and, by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he’s a fine man."
420	0	"Yes, Jon."
421	0	"On the leaks, sir —"
422	0	"Go ahead, finish off, then I’ll get you, Jon."
423	0	"Sorry, what will you do on the leaks?"
424	0	You have said twice today —
425	0	"Yes, we’re looking at it very, very seriously."
426	0	"I’ve gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies, and we’re — I’ve actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks."
427	0	Those are criminal leaks.
428	0	They’re put out by people either in agencies.
429	0	I think you’ll see it stopping because now we have our people in.
430	0	"You know, again, we don’t have our people in because we can’t get them approved by the Senate."
431	0	"We just had Jeff Sessions approved in Justice, as an example."
432	0	So we are looking into that very seriously.
433	0	It’s a criminal act.
434	0	"You know what I say — when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked."
435	0	"Because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment."
436	0	"When I was called out on Mexico, I was — honestly, I was really, really surprised."
437	0	"But I said, you know, it doesn’t make sense, that won’t happen."
438	0	"But that wasn’t that important to call, it was fine."
439	0	"I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world — the President who is a very fine man, by the way."
440	0	Same thing with Australia.
441	0	"I said, that’s terrible that it was leaked but it wasn’t that important."
442	0	"But then I said, what happens when I’m dealing with the problem of North Korea?"
443	0	What happens when I’m dealing with the problems in the Middle East?
444	0	"Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information — very important, very — I mean, at the highest level, are you going to be reporting about that too?"
445	0	So I don’t want classified information getting out to the public.
446	0	"And in a way, that was almost a test."
447	0	So I’m dealing with Mexico.
448	0	I’m dealing with Argentina.
449	0	We were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn.
450	0	All this information gets put into the Washington Post and gets put into the New York Times.
451	0	"And I’m saying, what’s going to happen when I’m dealing on the Middle East?"
452	0	"What’s going to happen when I’m dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?"
453	0	We’ve got to stop it.
454	0	That’s why it’s a criminal penalty.
455	0	"Yes, Jon."
456	0	"Thank you, Mr. President."
457	0	I just want to get you to clarify just a very important point.
458	0	Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign?
459	0	"And, on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?"
460	0	"Well, the leaks are real."
461	0	You’re the one that wrote about them and reported them.
462	0	"I mean, the leaks are real."
463	0	You know what they said — you saw it.
464	0	And the leaks are absolutely real.
465	0	The news is fake because so much of the news is fake.
466	0	"So one thing that I felt it was very important to do — and I hope we can correct it, because there is nobody I have more respect for — well, maybe a little bit — than reporters, than good reporters."
467	0	"It’s very important to me, and especially in this position."
468	0	It’s very important.
469	0	I don’t mind bad stories.
470	0	I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it’s true.
471	0	"And over a course of time, I’ll make mistakes and you’ll write badly and I’m okay with that."
472	0	But I’m not okay when it is fake.
473	0	"I mean, I watch CNN — it’s so much anger and hatred and just the hatred."
474	0	I don’t watch it anymore because it’s very good — he’s saying no.
475	0	"It’s okay, Jim."
476	0	"It’s okay, Jim."
477	0	You’ll have your chance.
478	0	But I watch others too.
479	0	"You’re not the only one, so don’t feel badly."
480	0	But I think it should be straight.
481	0	"I think it should be — I think it would be, frankly, more interesting."
482	0	"I know how good everybody’s ratings are right now, but I think that actually would be — I think that it would actually be better."
483	1	"People — I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress."
484	0	I think that’s right.
485	0	"I don’t know, Peter, is that one right?"
486	0	"Because you know, I think they have lower — I heard, lower than Congress."
487	0	"But honestly, the public would appreciate it."
488	0	I’d appreciate it.
489	0	"Again, I don’t mind bad stories when it’s true."
490	0	But we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult.
491	0	"I think we’re setting a record, or close to a record in the time of approval of a Cabinet."
492	0	"I mean, the numbers are crazy."
493	0	When I’m looking — some of them had them approved immediately.
494	0	"I’m going forever, and I still have a lot of people that we’re waiting for."
495	0	"And that’s all they’re doing, is delaying."
496	0	"And you look at Schumer and the mess that he’s got over there, and they have nothing going."
497	0	The only thing they can do is delay.
498	0	"And you know, I think they’d be better served by approving and making sure that they’re happy and everybody is good."
499	0	"And sometimes, I mean — I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way."
500	0	And that’s okay.
501	0	That’s fine.
502	0	"But I think they would be much better served, Jon, if they just went through the process quickly."
503	0	This is pure delay tactics.
504	0	"And they say it, and everybody understands it."
505	0	"Yeah, go ahead, Jim."
506	0	The first part of my question on contacts.
507	0	Do you definitively say that nobody —
508	0	"Well, I had nothing to do with it."
509	0	I have nothing to do with Russia.
510	0	"I told you, I have no deals there."
511	0	I have no anything.
512	0	"Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give — they’re not giving classified information."
513	1	"They’re giving stuff — what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates — which, by the way, nobody mentions."
514	1	Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates.
515	0	"Can you imagine — seriously, can you imagine if I received the questions?"
516	0	"It would be the electric chair, okay?"
517	0	"He should be put in the electric chair. You would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, okay?"
518	0	"Maybe not you, Jon."
519	0	"Yes, we’ll do you next, Jim."
520	0	I’ll do you next.
521	0	Yes?
522	0	"Thank you, Mr. President."
523	0	I just want to clarify one other thing.
524	0	Sure.
525	0	Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss the sanctions with the Russian ambassador?
526	0	"No, I didn’t."
527	0	"No, I didn’t."
528	0	(Inaudible.)
529	0	(Off mic.)
530	0	"No, I didn’t."
531	0	Did you fire him because (inaudible)
532	0	"Excuse me — no, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence, very simple."
533	0	Mike was doing his job.
534	0	He was calling countries and his counterparts.
535	0	So it certainly would have been okay with me if he did it.
536	0	I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn’t doing it.
537	0	I didn’t direct him but I would have directed him because that’s his job.
538	0	"And it came out that way — and, in all fairness, I watched Dr."
539	0	Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job.
540	0	And I agreed with him.
541	0	And since then I’ve watched many other people say that.
542	0	"No, I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn’t do it, okay?"
543	0	Jim.
544	0	"Mr. President, thank you very much."
545	0	"And just for the record, we don’t hate you, I don’t hate you."
546	0	If you could pass that along.
547	0	Okay.
548	0	"Well, ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job, okay?"
549	0	"If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far, sir."
550	0	"Well, not too many."
551	0	We do have other people.
552	0	"You do have other people, and your ratings aren’t as good as some of the other people that are waiting."
553	0	"They’re pretty good right now, actually."
554	0	Okay.
555	0	"Go ahead, Jim."
556	0	"If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle."
557	0	You welcomed that at one point.
558	0	I was okay with it.
559	0	You said you loved WikiLeaks.
560	0	"At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30,000 emails."
561	0	"I’m wondering, sir, if you —"
562	0	"Well, she was actually missing 33,000, and then that got extended with a whole pile after that, but that’s okay."
563	0	Maybe my numbers are off a little bit too.
564	0	"No, no, but I did say 30,000, but it was actually higher than that."
565	0	"If I may ask you, sir, it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged in the campaign."
566	0	"Okay, fair question."
567	0	Ready?
568	0	So if I may ask you that — if I may ask a follow-up —
569	0	"No, no, but are you — let me do one at a time."
570	0	Do you mind?
571	0	"Yes, sir."
572	0	All right.
573	0	So in one case you’re talking about highly classified information.
574	0	In the other case you’re talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss.
575	0	"I will say this: If John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun."
576	0	He said terrible things about her.
577	0	But it wasn’t classified information.
578	0	But in one case you’re talking about classified.
579	0	"Regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong — at my suggestion — and I give Reince great credit for this — at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism."
580	0	I don’t want to be hacked.
581	0	"And we did that, and you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed."
582	0	The DNC did not do that.
583	0	"And if they did it, they could not have been hacked."
584	0	"But they were hacked, and terrible things came."
585	0	"And the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so — they were — when I heard some of those things, I said — I picked up the papers the next morning, I said, oh, this is going to front page."
586	0	It wasn’t even in the papers.
587	0	"Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers."
588	0	I would have been the headline in every newspaper.
589	0	"I mean, think of it."
590	0	"They gave her the questions for the debate, and she should have reported herself."
591	0	"Why didn’t Hillary Clinton announce that, ""I’m sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it’s inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job""?"
592	0	"And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl was asking you about — you said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake."
593	0	I guess I don’t understand.
594	0	It seems that there is a disconnect there.
595	0	"If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?"
596	0	"Well, the reporting is fake."
597	0	"Look, look —"
598	0	And if I may ask — I just want to ask one other question.
599	0	"Jim, you know what it is?"
600	0	Here’s the thing.
601	0	"The public isn’t — they read newspapers, they see television, they watch."
602	0	They don’t know if it’s true or false because they’re not involved.
603	0	I’m involved.
604	0	I’ve been involved with this stuff all my life.
605	0	But I’m involved.
606	0	So I know when you’re telling the truth or when you’re not.
607	0	"I just see many, many untruthful things."
608	0	And I tell you what else I see.
609	0	I see tone.
610	0	"You know the word ""tone."""
611	0	The tone is such hatred.
612	0	"I’m really not a bad person, by the way."
613	0	"No, but the tone is such — I do get good ratings, you have to admit that."
614	0	The tone is such hatred.
615	0	"I watched this morning a couple of the networks, and I have to say ""Fox & Friends"" in the morning, they’re very honorable people."
616	0	"They’re very — not because they’re good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong."
617	0	But they have the most honest morning show.
618	0	That’s all I can say.
619	0	It’s the most honest.
620	0	"But the tone, Jim."
621	0	If you look — the hatred.
622	0	"I mean, sometimes — sometimes somebody gets —"
623	0	(Off mic.)
624	0	"Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o’clock in the evening."
625	0	You just take a look at that show.
626	0	That is a constant hit.
627	0	The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump.
628	0	The good news is he doesn’t have good ratings.
629	0	But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump.
630	0	"And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth, the hatred coming from other people on your network."
631	0	"Now, I will say this."
632	0	I watch it.
633	0	I see it.
634	0	I’m amazed by it.
635	0	And I just think you’d be a lot better off — I honestly do.
636	0	"The public gets it, you know."
637	0	"Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN."
638	0	They want to throw their placards at CNN.
639	0	I think you would do much better by being different.
640	0	But you just take a look.
641	0	Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening.
642	0	"If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it’s brutal."
643	0	"Now, they’ll take this news conference."
644	0	"I’m actually having a very good time, okay?"
645	0	But they’ll take this news conference — don’t forget that’s the way I won.
646	0	"Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day."
647	0	(Off mic.)
648	0	"No, that’s how I won."
649	0	I won with news conferences and probably speeches.
650	0	"I certainly didn’t win by people listening to you people, that’s for sure."
651	0	But I am having a good time.
652	0	"Tomorrow they will say, Donald Trump rants and raves at the press."
653	0	I’m not ranting and raving.
654	0	"I’m just telling you, you’re dishonest people."
655	0	But — but I’m not ranting and raving.
656	0	I love this.
657	0	I’m having a good time doing it.
658	0	But tomorrow the headlines are going to be: Donald Trump Rants and Raves.
659	0	I’m not ranting and raving.
660	0	If I may just —
661	0	Go ahead.
662	0	One more follow-up because —
663	0	Should I let him have a little bit more?
664	0	"What do you think, Peter?"
665	0	Just because of this —
666	0	"Peter, should I have let him have a little bit more?"
667	0	Sit down.
668	0	Sit down.
669	0	Just because of the attack —
670	0	We’ll get it.
671	0	"Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir —"
672	0	"I’m changing it from fake news, though."
673	0	Doesn’t that undermine —
674	0	Very fake news now.
675	0	(LAUGHTER)
676	0	But aren’t you —
677	0	"Yes, go ahead."
678	0	"Real news, Mr. President."
679	0	Real news.
680	0	And you’re not related to our new —
681	0	"I am not related, sir, no."
682	0	(LAUGHTER)
683	0	"I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say."
684	0	"I looked — you know, I looked at that name."
685	0	"I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there?"
686	0	Alex Acosta.
687	0	"I’m sure you checked that out, sir."
688	0	"No, I checked it."
689	0	"I said — they said, no, sir."
690	0	"I said, do me a favor, go back and check the family tree."
691	0	"But aren’t you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people’s faith in the First Amendment freedom of the press, the press in this country when you call stories you don’t like ""fake news""?"
692	0	Why not just say it’s a story I don’t like?
693	0	I do that.
694	0	"When you call it fake news, you’re undermining confidence —"
695	0	"No, I do that."
696	0	"No, no, I do that."
697	0	— in our news media.
698	0	Here’s the thing.
699	0	Isn’t that important?
700	0	"Okay, I understand — and you’re right about that except this."
701	0	"See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad."
702	0	"And sometimes I’ll say, wow, that’s going to be a great story, and I’ll get killed."
703	0	I know what’s good and bad.
704	0	I’d be a pretty good reporter — not as good as you.
705	0	But I know what’s good.
706	0	I know what’s bad.
707	0	And when they change it and make it really bad — something that should be positive.
708	0	"Sometimes something that should be very positive, they’ll make okay."
709	0	They’ll even make it negative.
710	0	So I understand it because I’m there.
711	0	I know what was said.
712	0	I know who is saying it.
713	0	I’m there.
714	0	So it’s very important to me.
715	0	"Look, I want to see an honest press."
716	0	When I started off today by saying that it’s so important to the public to get an honest press.
717	0	The press — the public doesn’t believe you people anymore.
718	0	"Now, maybe I had something to do with that, I don’t know."
719	0	But they don’t believe you.
720	0	"If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right?"
721	0	"Of course, he had some questions also."
722	0	"But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster, I would be your biggest fan in the world — including bad stories about me."
723	0	"But if you go — as an example, you’re CNN — I mean, it’s story after story after story is bad."
724	0	I won.
725	0	I won.
726	0	And the other thing: Chaos.
727	0	There’s zero chaos.
728	0	We are running — this is a fine-tuned machine.
729	0	And Reince happens to be doing a good job.
730	0	But half of his job is putting out lies by the press.
731	0	"I said to him yesterday, this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don’t talk about the real subject, which is illegal leaks."
732	0	But I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper.
733	0	"And I’m saying, here’s my Chief of Staff, a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC."
734	0	"I mean, we won the election, right?"
735	0	We won the presidency.
736	0	We got some senators.
737	0	"We got some — all over the country, you take a look, he’s done a great job."
738	0	"And I said to myself, you know — and I said to somebody that was in the room — I said, you take a look at Reince, he’s working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires."
739	0	They’re fake.
740	0	They’re not true.
741	0	"And isn’t that a shame, because he’d rather be working on health care."
742	0	"He’d rather be working on tax reform, Jim."
743	0	I mean that.
744	0	I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right.
745	0	"I sort of understand there’s a certain bias, maybe by Jeff or somebody — for whatever reason."
746	0	And I understand that.
747	0	But you’ve got to be at least a little bit fair.
748	0	And that’s why the public sees it — they see it.
749	0	They see it’s not fair.
750	0	You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred.
751	0	And the public is smart.
752	0	They understand it.
753	0	"Okay, yeah, go ahead."
754	0	We have no doubt that your latest story is (inaudible).
755	0	"But for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over these last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn’t fake news?"
756	0	And secondly —
757	0	I think they don’t believe it.
758	0	I don’t think the public would.
759	0	That’s why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof.
760	0	I don’t think they believe it.
761	0	"Well, I guess one of the reasons I’m here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing — that’s a ruse."
762	0	That’s a ruse.
763	0	"And, by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that."
764	0	"Now, tomorrow you’ll say, Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible."
765	0	It’s not terrible — it’s good.
766	0	We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset.
767	1	We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country.
768	0	"You know what uranium is, right?"
769	0	It’s this thing called nuclear weapons and other things.
770	0	"Like, lots of things are done with uranium, including some bad things."
771	0	Nobody talks about that.
772	0	I didn’t do anything for Russia.
773	0	I’ve done nothing for Russia.
774	1	Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium.
775	0	"Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember, with the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks?"
776	0	"Here, take a look."
777	0	"He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button?"
778	0	Hillary Clinton — that was a reset.
779	0	Remember?
780	0	"It said ""reset."""
781	0	"Now, if I do that, oh, I’m a bad guy."
782	0	"If we could get along with Russia, that’s a positive thing."
783	0	"We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who is going to be meeting with them shortly."
784	0	"And I told him, I said, I know politically it’s probably not good for me."
785	0	"Hey, the greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that’s 30 miles offshore right out of the water."
786	0	"Everyone in this country is going to say, oh, it’s so great."
787	0	That’s not great.
788	0	That’s not great.
789	0	I would love to be able to get along with Russia.
790	0	"Now, you’ve had a lot of Presidents that haven’t taken that tact."
791	0	Look where we are now.
792	0	Look where we are now.
793	0	"So, if I can — now, I love to negotiate things."
794	0	"I do it really well and all that stuff, but it’s possible I won’t be able to get along with Putin."
795	0	Maybe it is.
796	0	"But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people — the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia."
797	0	"And probably Putin said, you know — he’s sitting behind his desk and he’s saying, you know, I see what’s going on in the United States, I follow it closely; it’s got to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he’s got with this fake story."
798	0	Okay?
799	0	And that’s a shame.
800	0	"Because if we could get along with Russia — and, by the way, China and Japan and everyone — if we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing."
801	0	"Mr. President, since you —"
802	0	Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly.
803	0	We’re doing Obamacare — we’re in final stages.
804	0	"We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say."
805	0	"And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first."
806	0	"It’s not like — frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the health care sooner."
807	0	"So we’ll be submitting health care sometime in early March, mid-March."
808	0	"And after that, we’re going to come up — and we’re doing very well on tax reform."
809	0	Yes.
810	0	"Mr. President, you mentioned Russia."
811	0	Let’s talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as President of the United States.
812	0	Okay.
813	0	"You mentioned the vessel, the spy vessel, off the coast of the United States."
814	0	Not good.
815	0	There was a ballistic missile test that many interpreted as a violation —
816	0	Not good.
817	0	— of the agreement between the two countries.
818	0	And a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer.
819	0	Not good.
820	0	I listened to you during the campaign —
821	0	"Excuse me, excuse me, when did it happen?"
822	0	"It happened when — if you were Putin right now, you would say, hey, we’re back to the old games with the United States."
823	0	"There’s no way Trump can ever do a deal with us because the — you have to understand, if I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, oh, isn’t that wonderful."
824	0	But I know you well enough.
825	0	"Then you would say, oh, he was too tough, he shouldn’t have done that."
826	0	"Look, of all —"
827	0	I’m just trying to find out your orientation to those —
828	0	Wait a minute.
829	0	"Wait, wait."
830	0	Excuse me just one second.
831	0	"I’m just trying to find out what you’re doing to do about them, Mr. President."
832	0	"All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he’s not going to be able to make a deal with me because it’s politically not popular for me to make a deal."
833	0	"So Hillary Clinton tries to reset, it failed."
834	0	They all tried.
835	0	But I’m different than those people.
836	0	Go ahead.
837	0	How are you interpreting those moves?
838	0	And what do you intend to do about them?
839	0	Just the way I said it.
840	0	Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal?
841	0	I have.
842	0	I have.
843	0	And I’m so beautifully represented.
844	0	I’m so honored that the Senate approved him.
845	0	He’s going to be fantastic.
846	0	"Yes, I think that I’ve already —"
847	0	"Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir?"
848	0	"No, I don’t think so."
849	0	I think Putin probably assumes that he can’t make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal.
850	0	"I can’t believe I’m saying I’m a politician, but I guess that’s what I am now."
851	0	"Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we’re not going to make a deal."
852	0	"Now, I don’t know that we’re going to make a deal."
853	0	I don’t know.
854	0	"We might, we might not."
855	0	"But it would be much easier for me to be so tough — the tougher I am on Russia, the better."
856	0	"But you know what, I want to do the right thing for the American people."
857	0	"And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world."
858	0	"If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along — and don’t forget, we’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they."
859	0	There’s no upside.
860	0	We’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they.
861	0	I’ve been briefed.
862	0	"And I can tell you, one thing about a briefing that we’re allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it: Nuclear holocaust would be like no other."
863	0	They’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are we.
864	0	"If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing."
865	0	"So when you say they’re not good, do you mean that they are —"
866	0	Who did I say is not good?
867	0	"No, when I read off the three things that have recently happened and each one of them you said they’re not good."
868	0	"No, it’s not good, but they happened."
869	0	But do they damage the relationship?
870	0	Do they undermine this country’s ability to work with Russia?
871	0	"They all happened recently, and I understand what they’re doing, because they’re doing the same thing."
872	0	"Now, again, maybe I’m not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried."
873	0	"And if I don’t, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump?"
874	0	Does anybody in this room really believe that?
875	0	Okay.
876	0	But I tell you one thing: She tried to make a deal.
877	0	She had the reset.
878	0	She gave all the valuable uranium away.
879	0	She did other things.
880	0	"You know, they say I’m close to Russia."
881	0	Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States.
882	0	She’s close to Russia.
883	0	I gave — you know what I gave to Russia?
884	0	You know what I gave?
885	0	Nothing.
886	0	Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations?
887	0	I’m not going to tell you anything about what response I do.
888	0	I don’t talk about military response.
889	0	I don’t say I’m going into Mosul in four months.
890	0	"We are going to attack Mosul in four months. Then three months later: ""We are going to attack Mosul in one month."" ""Next week, we are going to attack Mosul."" In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult."
891	0	Do you know why?
892	0	"Because I don’t talk about military, and I don’t talk about certain other things."
893	0	You’re going to be surprised to hear that.
894	0	"And, by the way, my whole campaign, I’d say that."
895	0	So I don’t have to tell you —
896	0	There will be a response?
897	0	"I don’t want to be one of these guys that say, ""Yes, here’s what we’re going to do."""
898	0	 I don’t have to do that.
899	0	"There will be a — in other words, there will be a response, Mr. President?"
900	0	I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea.
901	0	Wait a minute.
902	0	I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea.
903	0	And I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do with Iran.
904	0	You know why?
905	0	Because they shouldn’t know.
906	0	And eventually you guys are going to get tired of asking that question.
907	0	"So when you ask me, what am I going to do with the ship — the Russian ship, as an example — I’m not going to tell you."
908	0	"But hopefully, I won’t have to do anything."
909	0	But I’m not going to tell you.
910	0	Okay.
911	0	Thanks.
912	0	"Can I just ask you — thank you very much, Mr. President — the Trump —"
913	0	Where are you from?
914	0	BBC.
915	0	Okay.
916	0	Here’s another beauty.
917	0	That’s a good line.
918	0	"Impartial, free, and fair."
919	0	"Yeah, sure."
920	0	Mr. President —
921	0	"Just like CNN, right?"
922	0	"Mr. President, on the travel ban — we could banter back and forth."
923	0	"On the travel ban, would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government, that fine-tuned —"
924	0	"Yeah, I do."
925	0	I do.
926	0	And let me tell you about the travel —
927	0	Were there any mistakes in that?
928	0	"Wait, wait, wait."
929	0	I know who you are.
930	0	Just wait.
931	0	Let me tell you about the travel ban.
932	0	"We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban, but we had a bad court."
933	0	We got a bad decision.
934	0	"We had a court that’s been overturned — again, maybe wrong, but I think it’s 80 percent of the time."
935	0	A lot.
936	0	We had a bad decision.
937	0	We’re going to keep going with that decision.
938	0	We’re going to put in a new executive order next week sometime.
939	0	But we had a bad decision.
940	0	That’s the only thing that was wrong with the travel ban.
941	0	You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports.
942	0	"You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice buses, and they were put out at various locations."
943	0	"Despite that, the only problem that we had is we had a bad court."
944	0	"We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision."
945	0	Very bad for the safety and security of our country.
946	0	The rollout was perfect.
947	0	"Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order but said one thing — and I said this to my people: Give them a one-month period of time."
948	0	"But General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, said, if you do that, all these people will come in, in the month — the bad ones."
949	0	"You do agree, there are bad people out there, right?"
950	0	They’re not everybody that’s like you.
951	0	You have some bad people out there.
952	0	"So Kelly said, you can’t do that."
953	0	And he was right.
954	0	"As soon as he said it, I said, wow, never thought of it."
955	0	"I said, how about one week?"
956	0	"He said, no good."
957	0	"You got to do it immediately, because if you do it immediately, they don’t have time to come in."
958	0	"Now, nobody ever reports that, but that’s why we did it quickly."
959	0	"Now, if would have done it a month, everything would have been perfect."
960	0	"The problems is we would have wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives, because a lot of bad people would have come into our country."
961	0	"Now, in the meantime, we’ve vetting very, very strongly."
962	0	"Very, very strongly."
963	0	"But we need help, and we need help by getting that executive order passed."
964	0	Just a brief follow-up.
965	0	"And if it’s so urgent, why not introduce —"
966	0	"Yes, go ahead."
967	0	Thank you.
968	0	I just was hoping that we could get a yes- or-no answer on one of these questions involving Russia.
969	0	Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?
970	0	"Well, I told you, General Flynn obviously was dealing."
971	0	So that’s one person.
972	0	But he was dealing — as he should have been —
973	0	During the election?
974	0	"No, no, nobody that I know of."
975	0	So you’re not aware of any contacts during the course of the election?
976	0	"Look, look, how many times do I have to answer this question?"
977	0	Can you just say yes or no on it?
978	0	Russia is a ruse.
979	0	"Yeah, I know you have to get up and ask a question, so important."
980	0	Russia is a ruse.
981	0	"I have nothing to do with Russia, haven’t made a phone call to Russia in years."
982	0	Don’t speak to people from Russia.
983	0	"Not that I wouldn’t, I just have nobody to speak to."
984	0	I spoke to Putin twice.
985	0	"He called me on the election — I told you this — and he called me on the inauguration, and a few days ago."
986	0	"We had a very good talk, especially the second one — lasted for a pretty long period of time."
987	0	"I’m sure you probably get it because it was classified, so I’m sure everybody in this room perhaps has it."
988	0	"But we had a very, very good talk."
989	0	I have nothing to do with Russia.
990	0	"To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does."
991	0	"Now, Manafort has totally denied it."
992	0	He denied it.
993	0	"Now, people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia."
994	0	"I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that — whoever."
995	0	But people knew that.
996	0	Everybody knew that.
997	0	"But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election?"
998	0	"I have — you know what, he said no."
999	0	"I can only tell you what he — now, he was replaced long before the election."
1000	0	"You know that, right?"
1001	0	He was replaced long before the election.
1002	0	"When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election."
1003	0	"But Paul Manafort, who’s a good man also, by the way — Paul Manafort was replaced long before the election took place."
1004	0	He was only there for a short period of time.
1005	0	"How much longer should we stay here, folks?"
1006	0	"Five more minutes, is that okay?"
1007	0	Five?
1008	0	"Mr. President, on national security —"
1009	0	"Wait, let’s see, who’s — I want to find a friendly reporter."
1010	0	Are you a friendly reporter?
1011	0	Watch how friendly he is.
1012	0	"Wait, wait — watch how friendly he is."
1013	0	Go ahead.
1014	0	Go ahead.
1015	0	"So, first of all, my name is (inaudible) from (inaudible) Magazine."
1016	0	And (inaudible).
1017	0	I haven’t seen anybody in my community accuse either yourself or any of the — anyone on your staff of being anti-Semitic.
1018	0	We have an understanding of (inaudible).
1019	0	Thank you.
1020	0	"However, what we are concerned about, and what we haven’t really heard be addressed is an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the government is planning to take care of it."
1021	0	There have been reports out that 48 bomb threats have been made against Jewish centers all across the country in the last couple of weeks.
1022	0	There are people who are committing anti-Semitic acts or threatening to —
1023	0	"You see, he said he was going to ask a very simple, easy question."
1024	0	And it’s not.
1025	0	It’s not.
1026	0	"Not a simple question, not a fair question."
1027	0	"Okay, sit down."
1028	0	I understand the rest of your question.
1029	0	"So here’s the story, folks."
1030	0	"Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life."
1031	0	"Number two, racism — the least racist person."
1032	0	"In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican."
1033	0	(Inaudible.)
1034	0	"Quiet, quiet, quiet."
1035	0	"See, he lied about — he was going to get up and ask a very straight, simple question."
1036	0	"So you know, welcome to the world of the media."
1037	0	But let me just tell you something — that I hate the charge.
1038	0	I find it repulsive.
1039	0	"I hate even the question because people that know me — and you heard the Prime Minister, you heard Netanyahu yesterday — did you hear him, Bibi?"
1040	0	"He said, I’ve known Donald Trump for a long time, and then he said, forget it."
1041	0	"So you should take that, instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that."
1042	0	"Yeah, go ahead."
1043	0	Go ahead.
1044	0	Thank you.
1045	0	I’m Lisa from the PBS —
1046	0	"See, it just shows you about the press, but that’s the way the press is."
1047	0	"Thank you, Mr. President."
1048	0	Lisa Desjardins from the PBS Newshour.
1049	0	Good.
1050	0	"On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you planned for next week, even its broad outlines?"
1051	0	Will it be focused on specific countries?
1052	0	It’s a very fair question.
1053	0	"And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration, what is your plan?"
1054	0	Do you plan to continue that program or to end it?
1055	0	We’re going to show great heart.
1056	0	"DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you."
1057	0	"To me, it’s one of the most difficult subjects I have, because you have these incredible kids, in many cases — not in all cases."
1058	0	In some of the cases they’re having DACA and they’re gang members and they’re drug dealers too.
1059	0	"But you have some absolutely incredible kids — I would say mostly — they were brought here in such a way — it’s a very, very tough subject."
1060	0	We are going to deal with DACA with heart.
1061	0	"I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don’t forget, and I have to convince them that what I’m saying is right."
1062	0	And I appreciate your understanding on that.
1063	0	"But the DACA situation is a very, very — it’s a very difficult thing for me."
1064	0	"Because, you know, I love these kids."
1065	0	I love kids.
1066	0	I have kids and grandkids.
1067	0	"And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do."
1068	0	"And you know, the law is rough."
1069	0	I’m not talking about new laws.
1070	0	I’m talking the existing law is very rough.
1071	0	"It’s very, very rough."
1072	0	"As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad decision, but we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways more."
1073	0	But we’re tailoring it now to the decision.
1074	0	We have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it.
1075	0	And the new executive order is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court.
1076	0	Okay?
1077	0	"Mr. President, Melania Trump announced the reopening of the White House Visitors Office."
1078	0	"President, Melania Trump announced the reopening of the White House Visitors Office."
1079	0	Yes.
1080	0	And she does a lot of great work for the country as well.
1081	0	Can you tell us a little bit about what First Lady Melania Trump does for the country?
1082	0	"And there is a unique level of interest in your administration, so by opening the White House Visitors Office, what does that mean to you?"
1083	0	"Now, that’s what I call a nice question."
1084	0	That is very nice.
1085	0	Who are you with?
1086	0	(Inaudible.)
1087	0	Good.
1088	0	I’m going to start watching.
1089	0	Thank you very much.
1090	0	Melania is terrific.
1091	0	She was here last night.
1092	0	"We had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife, who is, by the way, lovely."
1093	0	And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba.
1094	0	"And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election as you know, the Cuban people, Americans."
1095	0	And I think that Melania is going to be outstanding.
1096	0	"That’s right, she just opened up the Visitors Center — in other words, touring of the White House."
1097	0	"She, like others that she’s working with, feels very, very strongly about women’s issues, women’s difficulties, very, very strongly."
1098	0	"And she’s a very, very strong advocate."
1099	0	I think she’s a great representative for this country.
1100	0	And a funny thing happens because she gets so unfairly maligned.
1101	0	The things they say — I’ve known her for a long time.
1102	0	She was a very successful person.
1103	0	She was a very successful model.
1104	0	She did really well.
1105	0	She would go home at night and didn’t even want to go out with people.
1106	0	She was a very private person.
1107	0	She was always the highest quality that you’ll ever find.
1108	0	And the things they say — and I’ve known her for a long time — the things they say are so unfair.
1109	0	"And actually, she’s been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies."
1110	0	I’d just tell you this: I think she’s going to be a fantastic First Lady.
1111	0	She’s going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people.
1112	0	"And helping her and working with her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman."
1113	0	And they’re not doing this for money.
1114	0	They’re not doing this for pay.
1115	0	"They’re doing this because they feel it, both of them."
1116	0	"And Melania goes back and forth, and after Barron finishes school — because it’s hard to take a child out of school with a few months left — she and Barron will be moving over to the White House."
1117	0	Thank you.
1118	0	That’s a very nice question.
1119	0	Go ahead.
1120	0	Mr. President.
1121	0	Yes.
1122	0	"Oh, this is going to be a bad question but that’s okay."
1123	0	"No, it’s not going to be a bad question."
1124	0	"Good, because I enjoy watching you on television."
1125	0	"Well, thank you so much."
1126	0	"Mr. President, I need to find out from you — you said something as it relates to inner cities."
1127	0	That was one of your platforms during your campaign.
1128	0	"Fix the inner cities, yes."
1129	0	Fixing the inner cities.
1130	0	"What will be that fix and your urban agenda, as well as your HBCU executive order that’s coming out this afternoon?"
1131	0	"See, it wasn’t bad, was it?"
1132	0	That was very professional and very good.
1133	0	I’m very professional.
1134	0	"We’ll be announcing the order in a little while, and I’d rather let the order speak for itself."
1135	0	But it will be something I think that will be very good for everybody concerned.
1136	0	But we’ll talk to you about that after we do the announcement.
1137	0	"As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign."
1138	0	I think it’s probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get.
1139	0	"We did much higher than people thought I was going to get and I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher."
1140	0	"And, by the way, if I might add, including the women’s vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get."
1141	0	"So we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities having to do with education, having to do with crime."
1142	0	We’re going to try and fix as quickly as possible — you know it takes a long time.
1143	0	"It’s taken 100 years or more for some of these places to evolve, and they evolved many of them very badly."
1144	0	"But we’re going to be working very hard on health and health care; very, very hard on education."
1145	0	"And also, we’re going to working in a stringent way, and a very good way, on crime."
1146	0	"You go to some of these inner city places, and it’s so sad when you look at the crime."
1147	0	"You have people — and I’ve seen this, and I’ve sort of witnessed it."
1148	0	"In fact, in two cases, I have actually witnessed it."
1149	0	"They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day."
1150	0	They’re living in hell.
1151	0	We can’t let that happen.
1152	0	"So we’re going to be very, very strong."
1153	0	"It’s a great question, and it’s a very difficult situation, because it’s been many, many years."
1154	0	"It’s been festering for many, many years."
1155	0	But we have places in this country that we have to fix.
1156	0	"We have to help African American people that, for the most part are stuck there — Hispanic American people."
1157	0	"We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities, and they’re living in hell."
1158	0	"I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago."
1159	0	"There are two Chicagos, as you know."
1160	0	"There’s one Chicago that’s incredible, luxurious and all, and safe."
1161	0	"There’s another Chicago that’s worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk about, and that you talk about every night on the newscasts."
1162	0	So we’re going to do a lot of work on the inner cities.
1163	0	I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities.
1164	0	"Well, when you say — when you say the inner cities, are you going to include the CBC, Mr."
1165	0	"President, in your conversations with your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as your —"
1166	0	Am I going include who?
1167	0	"Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, as well as —"
1168	0	"Well, I would."
1169	0	"I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting?"
1170	0	Do you want to set up the meeting?
1171	0	"No, no, no."
1172	0	Are they friends of yours?
1173	0	I’m just a reporter.
1174	0	"No, go ahead, set up the meeting."
1175	0	"I know some of them, but I’m sure they’re watching right now."
1176	0	Let’s go set up a meeting.
1177	0	I would love to meet with the Black Caucus.
1178	0	I think it’s great — the Congressional Black Caucus.
1179	0	I think it’s great.
1180	0	"I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings, and he was all excited, and then he said, oh, I can’t move, it might be bad for me politically, I can’t have that meeting."
1181	0	I was all set to have the meeting.
1182	0	"You know, we called him and called him, and he was all set."
1183	0	I spoke to him on the phone.
1184	0	Very nice guy.
1185	0	I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well.
1186	0	He wanted it.
1187	0	"But we called, called, called, called — they can’t make a meeting with him."
1188	0	"Every day, I walked in, I said, I would like to meet with him."
1189	0	Because I do want to solve the problem.
1190	0	"But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that — some other lightweight — he was probably told — he was probably told, don’t meet with Trump, it’s bad politics."
1191	0	And that’s part of the problem of this country.
1192	0	"Okay, one more."
1193	0	Go ahead.
1194	0	"Yes, Mr. President, two questions —"
1195	0	"No, no."
1196	0	One question.
1197	0	"Two, we can’t handle."
1198	0	This room can’t handle two.
1199	0	"Go ahead, give me the better of your two."
1200	0	(Inaudible)
1201	0	it’s not about your personality or your beliefs.
1202	0	We’re talking about (inaudible)
1203	0	"around the country, some of it by supporters in your name."
1204	0	What do you —
1205	0	And some of it — and can I be honest with you?
1206	0	And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up.
1207	0	Some of it written by our opponents.
1208	0	You do know that.
1209	0	Do you understand that?
1210	0	You don’t think anybody would do a thing like that.
1211	0	"Some of the signs you’ll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, they’re put up by the other side, and you think it’s like playing it straight."
1212	0	No.
1213	0	"But you have some of those signs, and some of that anger is caused by the other side."
1214	0	They’ll do signs and they’ll do drawings that are inappropriate.
1215	0	It won’t be my people.
1216	0	It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you.
1217	0	Okay.
1218	0	Go ahead.
1219	0	You are the President now.
1220	0	What are you going to do about it?
1221	0	Where is that?
1222	0	"Oh, stand up."
1223	0	You can —
1224	0	What are you going to do about the tensions that have been discussed?
1225	0	"Oh, I’m working on it."
1226	0	"No, I’m working on it very hard."
1227	0	Are you going to give a speech?
1228	0	"No, no, look."
1229	0	"Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years, and long before that, in all fairness to President Obama."
1230	0	"Long before President Obama, we have had a very divided."
1231	0	I didn’t come along and divide this country.
1232	0	This country was seriously divided before I got here.
1233	0	We’re going to work on it very hard.
1234	0	One of the questions that was asked — I thought it was a very good question — was about the inner cities.
1235	0	"I mean, that’s part of it."
1236	0	But we’re going to work on education.
1237	0	"We’re going to work on lack — you know, we’re going to stop — we’re going to try and stop the crime."
1238	0	We have great law enforcement officials.
1239	0	We’re going to try and stop crime.
1240	0	"We’re not going to try and stop, we’re going to stop crime."
1241	0	But it’s very important to me.
1242	0	But this isn’t Donald Trump that divided a nation.
1243	0	"We went eight years with President Obama, and we went many years before President Obama."
1244	0	We lived in a divided nation.
1245	0	And I am going to try — I will do everything within my power to fix that.
1246	0	I want to thank everybody very much.
1247	0	It’s a great honor to be with you.
1248	0	Thank you.
1249	0	Thank you very much.
1250	0	(APPLAUSE)
1	0	Thank you very much.
2	0	"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States —"
3	0	(APPLAUSE)
4	0	" — and citizens of America: Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nation’s path towards civil rights and the work that still remains to be done."
5	0	(APPLAUSE)
6	0	"Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week’s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms."
7	0	(APPLAUSE)
8	0	"Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present."
9	0	That torch is now in our hands.
10	0	And we will use it to light up the world.
11	0	"I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart."
12	0	A new chapter —
13	0	(APPLAUSE)

21	0	"In nine years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding — 250 years since the day we declared our independence."
22	0	It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.
23	0	But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year?
24	0	What kind of country will we leave for our children?
25	0	I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.
26	0	"For too long, we’ve watched our middle class shrink as we’ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries."
27	0	"We’ve financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, and so many other places throughout our land."
28	1	We’ve defended the borders of other nations while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.
29	0	"And we’ve spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled."
30	0	"Then, in 2016, the Earth shifted beneath our feet."
31	0	"The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds — families who just wanted a fair shot for their children and a fair hearing for their concerns."
32	0	"But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country."
33	0	"Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand: that America must put its own citizens first."
34	0	Because only then can we truly make America great again.
35	0	(APPLAUSE)
36	0	Dying industries will come roaring back to life.
37	0	Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need.
38	0	Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.
39	0	"Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our very, very beautiful land."
40	0	"Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and, ultimately, stop."
41	0	"And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity."

43	0	(APPLAUSE)
44	0	"It’s been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I’ve made in keeping those promises."
45	1	"Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs."
46	0	(APPLAUSE)
47	0	"The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on November 8th, a record."
48	0	"We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of a fantastic — and it is a fantastic — new F-35 jet fighter, and we’ll be saving billions more on contracts all across our government."

56	0	(APPLAUSE)
57	0	We’re going to stop the regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal miners.
58	0	(APPLAUSE)
59	0	We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines —

76	0	(APPLAUSE)

78	0	We must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders.
79	0	(APPLAUSE)
80	0	"For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border."
81	0	(APPLAUSE)

83	0	"Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as I promised throughout the campaign."
84	0	"To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question:  What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?"
85	0	(APPLAUSE)
86	0	"Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States."
87	0	We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism.
88	0	(APPLAUSE)
89	0	"According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country."
90	0	"We have seen the attacks at home — from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon, and, yes, even the World Trade Center."
91	0	"We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany, and all over the world."
92	1	"It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur."
93	0	Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.
94	1	"It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur."
95	0	(APPLAUSE)
96	0	Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.
97	0	We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America.
98	0	We cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.
99	0	(APPLAUSE)
100	0	"That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe and to keep out those out who will do us harm."
101	0	(APPLAUSE)
102	0	"As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS — a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, and women, and children of all faiths and all beliefs."
103	0	"We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet."
104	0	(APPLAUSE)
105	0	"I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran’s ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel."
106	0	(APPLAUSE)
107	0	"Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the United States Supreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution."
108	0	(APPLAUSE)
109	0	I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.
110	0	(APPLAUSE)
111	0	"Thank you, Maureen."
112	0	"Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice."
113	0	"To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law."
114	0	"He was confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination."
115	0	(APPLAUSE)
116	0	"Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited."
117	1	Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.
118	0	"Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps."
119	1	More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working.
120	0	We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.
121	0	"In the last eight years, the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other Presidents combined."
122	0	"We’ve lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we’ve lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001."
123	0	Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars.
124	0	And overseas we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.
125	0	Solving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party.
126	0	It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.
127	0	"But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy — making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much, much harder for companies to leave our country."
128	0	(APPLAUSE)
129	0	"Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world."
130	0	My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.
131	0	(APPLAUSE)
132	0	"It will be a big, big cut."
133	0	"At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class."
134	0	We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers.
135	0	We have to do it.
136	0	(APPLAUSE)
137	0	"Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes."
138	0	"But when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing, or almost nothing."
139	0	"I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson."
140	0	"In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House."
141	0	(LAUGHTER)
142	0	(APPLAUSE)
143	0	"And they wanted me to ride one and I said, “No, thank you.”"
144	0	(LAUGHTER)
145	0	"At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business?"
146	0	They said that it’s good.
147	0	"I asked them further, how are you doing with other countries, mainly international sales?"
148	0	"They told me — without even complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they’ve become used to it — that it’s very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate."
149	0	"They said that in the case of another country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent."
150	0	They weren’t even asking for a change.
151	0	But I am.
152	0	(LAUGHTER)
153	0	I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be fair trade.
154	0	It’s been a long time since we had fair trade.
155	0	"The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the “abandonment of the protective policy by the American government… will produce want and ruin among our people.”"
156	0	Lincoln was right — and it’s time we heeded his advice and his words.
157	0	(APPLAUSE)
158	0	I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer.
159	0	They have taken advantage of our country.
160	0	No longer.
161	0	(APPLAUSE)
162	0	I am going to bring back millions of jobs.
163	0	Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.
164	0	(APPLAUSE)
165	0	"The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers."
166	0	"Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others, have a merit-based immigration system."
167	0	(APPLAUSE)
168	0	It’s a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially.
169	0	"Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon."
170	1	"According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year."
171	0	"Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more benefits."
172	0	"It will save countless dollars, raise workers’ wages, and help struggling families — including immigrant families — enter the middle class."
173	0	"And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed."
174	0	(APPLAUSE)
175	0	"I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals:  To improve jobs and wages for Americans; to strengthen our nation’s security; and to restore respect for our laws."
176	0	"If we are guided by the wellbeing of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades."
177	0	(APPLAUSE)
178	0	"Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program — the building of the Interstate Highway System."
179	0	The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.
180	0	(APPLAUSE)
181	1	"America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling."
182	0	With this six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our country – twice.
183	0	And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.
184	0	"To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States — financed through both public and private capital — creating millions of new jobs."
185	0	(APPLAUSE)
186	0	This effort will be guided by two core principles:  buy American and hire American.
187	0	(APPLAUSE)
188	0	"Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare —"
189	0	(APPLAUSE)
190	0	"— with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and, at the same time, provide better healthcare."
191	0	(APPLAUSE)
192	0	Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country.
193	0	(APPLAUSE)
194	0	"The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we are going do."
195	0	(APPLAUSE)
196	1	Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits.
197	1	"As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone."
198	1	Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State — it is unsustainable and collapsing.
199	0	"One-third of counties have only one insurer, and they are losing them fast."
200	0	They are losing them so fast.
201	0	"They are leaving, and many Americans have no choice at all."
202	0	There’s no choice left.
203	0	Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan?
204	0	We now know that all of those promises have been totally broken.
205	0	"Obamacare is collapsing, and we must act decisively to protect all Americans."
206	0	(APPLAUSE)
207	0	"Action is not a choice, it is a necessity."
208	0	So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.
209	0	(APPLAUSE)
210	0	Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans:
211	0	"First, we should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges."
212	0	(APPLAUSE)
213	0	"Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts — but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government."
214	0	(APPLAUSE)
215	0	"Thirdly, we should give our great state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out."
216	0	(APPLAUSE)
217	0	"Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance, and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs, and bring them down immediately."
218	0	(APPLAUSE)
219	0	"And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines —"
220	0	(APPLAUSE)
221	0	which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care.
222	0	So important.
223	0	Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed.
224	0	Every problem can be solved.
225	0	And every hurting family can find healing and hope.
226	0	"Our citizens deserve this, and so much more — so why not join forces and finally get the job done, and get it done right?"
227	0	(APPLAUSE)
228	0	"On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people."
229	0	(APPLAUSE)
230	1	"My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave, to invest in women’s health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure."
231	0	"True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future."
232	0	"An incredible young woman is with us this evening, who should serve as an inspiration to us all."
233	0	"Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley."
234	0	(APPLAUSE)
235	0	"Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old."
236	0	She was not expected to live past five.
237	0	"On receiving this news, Megan’s dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child."
238	0	"He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan’s life."
239	0	Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame.
240	0	(APPLAUSE)
241	0	Megan’s story is about the unbounded power of a father’s love for a daughter.
242	0	"But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan’s life, from reaching those in need."
243	0	"If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan."
244	0	(APPLAUSE)
245	0	"In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles."
246	0	"But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind and the souls of every American child."
247	0	Education is the civil rights issue of our time.
248	0	(APPLAUSE)
249	0	"I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African American and Latino children."
250	0	(APPLAUSE)
251	0	"These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious, or home school that is right for them."
252	0	(APPLAUSE)
253	0	"Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather."
254	0	"As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice."
255	0	But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning — a great learning center — with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship program.
256	0	"Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college."
257	0	Later this year she will get her master’s degree in social work.
258	0	We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.
259	0	(APPLAUSE)
260	0	"But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence."
261	1	The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.
262	0	"In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher."
263	0	This is not acceptable in our society.
264	0	(APPLAUSE)
265	0	"Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job."
266	0	(APPLAUSE)
267	0	"But to create this future, we must work with, not against — not against — the men and women of law enforcement."
268	0	(APPLAUSE)
269	0	"We must build bridges of cooperation and trust — not drive the wedge of disunity and, really, it’s what it is, division."
270	0	"It’s pure, unadulterated division."
271	0	We have to unify.
272	0	Police and sheriffs are members of our community.
273	0	"They’re friends and neighbors, they’re mothers and fathers, sons and daughters — and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they’ll come home safe and sound."
274	0	We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.
275	0	(APPLAUSE)
276	0	And we must support the victims of crime.
277	0	I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims.
278	0	The office is called VOICE — Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.
279	0	We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests.
280	0	(APPLAUSE)
281	0	Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.
282	0	"Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis."
283	0	Jamiel’s 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison.
284	0	"Jamiel Shaw, Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback."
285	0	But he never got the chance.
286	0	"His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a very good friend of mine."
287	0	"Jamiel, thank you."
288	0	Thank you.
289	0	(APPLAUSE)
290	0	Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis.
291	0	"Their husbands, Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis, were slain in the line of duty in California."
292	0	They were pillars of their community.
293	0	These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.
294	0	Should have never been in our country.
295	0	"Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna."
296	0	"Jenna, I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you."
297	0	(APPLAUSE)
298	0	"To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica, I want you to know that we will never stop fighting for justice."
299	0	"Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten."
300	0	We will always honor their memory.
301	0	(APPLAUSE)
302	0	"Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war — if they must — they have to fight and they only have to win."
303	0	(APPLAUSE)
304	0	"I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester — "
305	0	(APPLAUSE)
306	1	— and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.
307	0	My budget will also increase funding for our veterans.
308	0	"Our veterans have delivered for this nation, and now we must deliver for them."
309	0	(APPLAUSE)
310	0	"The challenges we face as a nation are great, but our people are even greater."
311	0	And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.
312	0	(APPLAUSE)
313	0	"We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William “Ryan” Owens."
314	0	"Ryan died as he lived:  a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation."
315	0	(APPLAUSE)
316	0	"I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed that — and I quote — “Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.”"
317	0	Ryan’s legacy is etched into eternity.
318	0	Thank you.
319	0	(APPLAUSE)
320	0	"And Ryan is looking down, right now — you know that — and he is very happy because I think he just broke a record."
321	0	(LAUGHTER)
322	0	(APPLAUSE)
323	0	"For as the Bible teaches us, “There is no greater act of love than to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.”"
324	0	"Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom."
325	0	And we will never forget Ryan.
326	0	(APPLAUSE)
327	0	"To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform."
328	0	"Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world."
329	0	It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe.
330	0	"We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War, and defeated communism."
331	0	(APPLAUSE)
332	0	But our partners must meet their financial obligations.
333	0	"And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that."
334	0	"In fact, I can tell you, the money is pouring in."
335	0	Very nice.
336	0	(APPLAUSE)
337	0	"We expect our partners — whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific — to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost."
338	0	Have to do that.
339	0	"We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations, and they have to respect our rights as a nation also."
340	0	(APPLAUSE)
341	0	"Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path."
342	0	My job is not to represent the world.
343	0	My job is to represent the United States of America.
344	0	(APPLAUSE)
345	0	"But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more."
346	0	We must learn from the mistakes of the past.
347	0	We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world — all across the world.
348	0	"The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding."
349	0	(APPLAUSE)
350	0	"America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align."
351	0	"We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict."
352	0	"We want peace, wherever peace can be found."
353	0	America is friends today with former enemies.
354	0	"Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars."
355	0	This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.
356	0	"Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just, and more free."
357	0	"On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America’s centennial."
358	0	"At that celebration, the country’s builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful creations."
359	0	Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.
360	0	Remington unveiled the first typewriter.
361	0	An early attempt was made at electric light.
362	0	Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.
363	0	Imagine the wonders our country could know in America’s 250th year.
364	0	(APPLAUSE)
365	0	Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.
366	0	Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.
367	0	American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.
368	1	Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.
369	0	"And streets where mothers are safe from fear, schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask."
370	0	(APPLAUSE)
371	0	"When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before — for all Americans."
372	0	This is our vision.
373	0	This is our mission.
374	0	But we can only get there together.
375	0	"We are one people, with one destiny."
376	0	We all bleed the same blood.
377	0	We all salute the same great American flag.
378	0	And we all are made by the same God.
379	0	(APPLAUSE)
380	0	"When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began."
381	0	The time for small thinking is over.
382	0	The time for trivial fights is behind us.
383	0	"We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action."
384	0	"From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears; inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past; and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts."
385	0	I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.
386	0	"I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold, and daring things for our country."
387	0	I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment.
388	0	"Believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe, once more, in America."
389	0	"Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States."
390	0	(APPLAUSE)
1	0	"Thank you very much, everybody."
2	0	Thank you.
3	0	(APPLAUSE)
4	0	"So we’re just going to let the other folks come in, fill it up."
5	0	This is some crowd.
6	0	"You have to see what’s outside, you wouldn’t even believe it."
7	0	(APPLAUSE)
8	0	Unbelievable.
9	0	"So I’m thrilled to be here in Nashville, Tennessee, the home —"
10	0	(APPLAUSE)
11	0	"— of country music, Southern hospitality, and the great President Andrew Jackson."
12	0	(APPLAUSE)
13	0	I just came from a tour of Andrew Jackson’s home to mark the 250th anniversary of his birth.
14	0	Jackson’s life was devoted to one very crucial principle — he understood that real leadership means putting America first.
15	0	(APPLAUSE)
16	0	"Before becoming President, Andrew Jackson served your state from the House of Representatives and in the United States Senate, and he also served as commander of the Tennessee militia."
17	0	Tough cookie.
18	0	Tough cookie.
19	0	(APPLAUSE)
20	0	So let’s begin tonight by thanking all of the incredible men and women of the United States military and all of our wonderful veterans.
21	0	The veterans.
22	0	(APPLAUSE)
23	0	USA!
24	0	USA!

70	0	(APPLAUSE)
71	0	"It’s been a little over 50 days since my inauguration, and we’ve been putting our America First agenda very much into action."
72	0	You see what’s happening.
73	0	We’re keeping our promises.
74	0	"In fact, they have signs — ""He’s Kept His Promise."""

81	0	"Wait until you see what’s coming, folks."

98	0	They have to pay.
99	0	(APPLAUSE)

101	0	"We’re going to protect the environment, we’re going to protect people’s safeties, but, let me tell you, the regulation business has become a terrible business, and we’re going to bring it down to where it should be."

117	0	A lot of jobs.

129	0	We’re not going to let it happen anymore.
130	0	"From now on, we are going to defend the American worker and our great American companies."
131	0	(APPLAUSE)
132	0	"And if America does what it says, and if your President does what I’ve been telling you, there is nobody anywhere in the world that can even come close to us, folks."
133	0	Not even close.

135	0	"If a company wants to leave America, fire their workers, and then ship their new products back into our country, there will be consequences."

138	0	"And by the way, aren’t our borders getting extremely strong?"
139	0	(APPLAUSE)
140	0	Very strong.
141	0	USA!
142	0	USA!
143	0	USA!
144	0	Don’t even think about it.
145	0	We will build the wall.
146	0	Don’t even think about it.
147	0	(APPLAUSE)
148	0	"In fact, as you probably read, we went out to bid."
149	0	We had hundreds of bidders.
150	0	Everybody wants to build our wall.
151	0	(APPLAUSE)
152	0	"Usually, that means we’re going to get a good price."
153	0	"We’re going to get a good price, believe me."
154	0	(APPLAUSE)
155	0	We’re going to build the wall.
156	0	"Some of the fake news said, I don’t think Donald Trump wants to build the wall."
157	0	Can you imagine if I said we’re not going to build a wall?
158	0	Fake news.
159	0	"Fake, fake news."
160	0	"Fake news, folks."
161	0	A lot of fake.
162	0	"No, the wall is way ahead of schedule in terms of where we are."
163	0	"It’s under design, and you’re going to see some very good things happening."
164	0	But the border by itself right now is doing very well.
165	0	It’s becoming very strong.
166	0	General Kelly has done a great job — General Kelly.
167	0	"My administration is also following through on our promise to secure, protect, and defend that border within our United States."
168	0	Our southern border will be protected always.
169	0	It will have the wall.
170	0	"Drugs will stop pouring in and poisoning our youth, and that will happen very, very soon."
171	0	You’re already seeing what’s going on.
172	0	"The drugs are pouring into our country, folks."
173	0	"They are poisoning our youth and plenty of others, and we’re going to stop it."
174	0	We’re not going to playing games.
175	0	Not going to be playing games.
176	0	(APPLAUSE)
177	0	"Following my executive action — and don’t forget, we’ve only been here for like — what? — 50 days — we’ve already experienced an unprecedented 40-percent reduction in illegal immigration on our Southern border; 61 percent since Inauguration Day — 61 percent."
178	0	Think about it.
179	0	"And now people are saying, we’re not going to go there anymore because we can’t get in."
180	0	So it’s going to get better and better.
181	0	"We got to stop those drugs, though."
182	0	We got to stop those drugs.
183	0	"During the campaign, as I traveled all across this country, I met with many American families whose loved ones were viciously and violently killed by illegal immigrants because our government refused to enforce our already existing laws."
184	0	These American victims were ignored by the media.
185	0	They were ignored by Washington.
186	0	"But they were not ignored by me, and they’re not ignored by you, and they never will be ignored certainly any longer."
187	0	Not going to happen.
188	0	(APPLAUSE)
189	0	"As we speak, we are finding the drug dealers, the robbers, thieves, gang members, killers and criminals preying on our citizens."
190	0	"One by one — you’re reading about it, right?"
191	0	They’re being thrown out of our country.
192	0	They’re being thrown into prisons.
193	0	And we will not let them back in.
194	0	(APPLAUSE)
195	0	"We’re also working, night and day, to keep our nation safe from terrorism."
196	0	(APPLAUSE)
197	1	We have seen the devastation from 9/11 to Boston to San Bernardino — hundreds upon hundreds of people from outside our country have been convicted of terrorism-related offenses in the United States courts.
198	1	Right now we have investigations going on all over — hundreds of refugees are under federal investigation for terrorism and related reasons.
199	0	We have entire regions of the world destabilized by terrorism and ISIS.
200	0	"For this reason, I issued an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration from places where it cannot safely occur."
201	0	(APPLAUSE)
202	0	But let me give you the bad news.
203	0	"We don’t like bad news, right?"
204	0	I don’t want to hear — and I’ll turn it into good.
205	0	"But let me give you the bad, the sad news."
206	0	"Moments ago, I learned that a district judge in Hawaii — part of the much overturned 9th Circuit Court — and I have to be nice; otherwise I’ll get criticized for speaking poorly about our courts."
207	0	"I’ll be criticized by these people, among the most dishonest people in the world — I will be criticized — I’ll be criticized by them for speaking harshly about our courts."
208	0	I would never want to do that.
209	0	A judge has just blocked our executive order on travel and refugees coming into our country from certain countries.
210	0	Booo —
211	0	The order he blocked was a watered-version of the first order that was also blocked by another judge and should have never been blocked to start with.
212	0	This new order was tailored to the dictates of the 9th Circuit’s — in my opinion — flawed ruling.
213	0	"This is, the opinion of many, an unprecedented judicial overreach."
214	0	The law and the Constitution give the President the power to suspend immigration when he deems — or she — or she.
215	0	"Fortunately, it will not be Hillary she."
216	0	(APPLAUSE)
217	0	When he or she deems it to be in the national interest of our country.
218	0	So we have a lot of lawyers here.
219	0	We also have a lot of smart people here.
220	0	"Let me read to you directly from the federal statute, 212F, of the immigration — and you know what I’m talking about, right?"
221	0	Can I read this to you?
222	0	Listen to this.
223	0	"Now, we’re all smart people."
224	0	"We’re all good students — some are bad students, but even if you’re a bad student this is a real easy one, let me tell you."
225	0	Ready?
226	0	So here’s the statute — which they don’t even want to quote when they overrule it.
227	0	And it was put here for the security of our country.
228	0	"And this goes beyond me, because there will be other Presidents, and we need this."
229	0	And sometimes we need it very badly for security — security of our country.
230	0	"It says — now, listen how easy this is."
231	0	"Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may, by proclamation, and for such period as he — see, it wasn’t politically correct, because it should say he or she."
232	0	"You know, today they’d say that."
233	0	"Actually, that’s the only mistake they made."
234	0	"as he shall deem necessary, suspending entry of all aliens, or any class of aliens, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or pose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deems to be appropriate."
235	0	"In other words, if he thinks there’s danger out there, he or she — whoever is President — can say, I’m sorry, folks, not now, please."
236	0	We’ve got enough problems.
237	0	(APPLAUSE)
238	0	"We’re talking about the safety of our nation, the safety and security of our people."
239	0	(APPLAUSE)
240	0	"Now, I know you people aren’t skeptical people because nobody would be that way in Tennessee."
241	0	Right?
242	0	Nobody — not Tennessee.
243	0	"You don’t think this was done by a judge for political reasons, do you?"
244	0	No.
245	0	Booo —
246	0	THE PRESIDENT:
247	0	"This ruling makes us look weak — which, by the way, we no longer are, believe me."
248	0	(APPLAUSE)
249	0	Just look at our borders.
250	0	We’re going to fight this terrible ruling.
251	0	"We’re going to take our case as far as it needs to go, including all the way up to the Supreme Court."
252	0	(APPLAUSE)
253	0	We’re going to win.
254	0	We’re going to keep our citizens safe.
255	0	"And regardless, we’re going to keep our citizens safe, believe me."
256	0	(APPLAUSE)
257	0	"Even liberal Democratic lawyer, Alan Dershowitz —- good lawyer — just said that we would win this case before the Supreme Court of the United States."
258	0	(APPLAUSE)
259	0	"Remember this, I wasn’t thrilled, but the lawyers all said, let’s tailor it."
260	0	This is a watered–down version of the first one.
261	0	This is a watered–down version.
262	0	"And let me tell you something, I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to do in the first one."
263	0	(APPLAUSE)
264	0	"The danger is clear, the law is clear, the need for my executive order is clear."
265	0	I was elected to change our broken and dangerous system and thinking in government that has weakened and endangered our country and left our people defenseless.
266	0	(APPLAUSE)
267	0	"And I will not stop fighting for the safety of you and your families, believe me."
268	0	"Not today, not ever."
269	0	We’re going to win it.
270	0	We’re going to win it.
271	0	(APPLAUSE)
272	0	We’re going to apply common sense.
273	0	We’re going to apply intelligence.
274	0	"And we’re never quitting, and we’re never going away, and we’re never, ever giving up."
275	0	"The best way to keep foreign terrorists — or, as some people would say in certain instances, radical Islamic terrorists — from attacking our country is to stop them from entering our country in the first place."
276	0	(APPLAUSE)
277	0	"We’ll take it, but these are the problems we have."
278	0	"People are screaming, break up the 9th Circuit."
279	0	"And I’ll tell you what, that 9th Circuit — you have to see."
280	0	Take a look at how many times they have been overturned with their terrible decisions.
281	0	Take a look.
282	0	And this is what we have to live with.
283	0	"Finally, I want to get to taxes."
284	0	"I want to cut the hell out of taxes, but —"
285	0	(APPLAUSE)
286	0	"— but before I can do that — I would have loved to have put it first, I’ll be honest — there is one more very important thing that we have to do, and we are going to repeal and replace horrible, disastrous Obamacare."
287	0	(APPLAUSE)
288	0	"If we leave Obamacare in place, millions and millions of people will be forced off their plans, and your senators just told me that in your state you’re down to practically no insurers."
289	0	You’re going to have nobody.
290	0	You’re going to have nobody.
291	0	And this is true all over.
292	0	The insurers are fleeing.
293	0	The insurers are fleeing.
294	0	"It’s a catastrophic situation, and there’s nothing to compare anything to because Obamacare won’t be around for a year or two."
295	0	It’s gone.
296	0	"So it’s not like, oh, gee, they have this."
297	0	Obamacare is gone.
298	0	Premiums will continue to soar double digits and even triple digits in many cases.
299	0	It will drain our budget and destroy our jobs.
300	0	Remember all of the broken promises?
301	0	"You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan."
302	0	Remember the wise guy — remember the wise guy that essentially said the American people — the so–called architect — the American people are stupid because they approved it?
303	0	We’re going to show them.
304	0	Those in Congress who made these promises have no credibility whatsoever on healthcare.
305	0	(APPLAUSE)
306	0	"And remember this — remember this:  If we took, because there’s such divisiveness — and I’m not just talking now, with me."
307	0	There was with Obama.
308	0	There was with Bush.
309	0	The level of hatred and divisiveness with the politicians.
310	0	"I remember years ago, I’d go to Washington — I was always very politically active — and Republicans and Democrats, they’d fight during the day and they go to dinner at night."
311	0	"Today, there’s a level that nobody has seen before."
312	0	"Just remember this:  If we submitted the Democrats’ plan, drawn everything perfect for the Democrats, we wouldn’t get one vote from the Democrats."
313	0	That’s the way it is.
314	0	That’s how much divisiveness and other things there are.
315	0	So it’s a problem.
316	0	But we’re going to get it by.
317	0	"So, I’ve met with so many victims of Obamacare —- the people who have been so horribly hurt by this horrible legislation."
318	0	At the very core of Obamacare was a fatal flaw — the government forcing people to buy a government–approved product.
319	0	There are very few people — very few people.
320	0	Booo —
321	0	By the way — watch what happens.
322	0	Now you just booed Obamacare.
323	0	"They will say, Trump got booed when he mentioned — they’re bad people, folks."
324	0	They’re bad people.
325	0	Booo —
326	0	"Tonight, I’ll go home, I’ll turn on, I’ll say — listen, I’ll turn on that television."
327	0	"My wife will say, darling, it’s too bad you got booed."
328	0	"I said, I didn’t get booed."
329	0	"This was a — I said, no, no, they were booing Obamacare."
330	0	"Watch, a couple of them will actually do it, almost guaranteed."
331	0	"But when we call them out, it makes it harder for them to do it."
332	0	So we’ll see.
333	0	"It’s the fake, fake media."
334	0	"We want Americans to be able to purchase the health insurance plans they want, not the plans forced on them by our government."
335	0	(APPLAUSE)
336	0	"The House has put forward a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare based on the principles I outlined in my joint address, but let me tell you, we’re going to arbitrate, we’re going to all get together and we’re going to get something done."
337	0	"Remember this — if we didn’t do it the way we’re doing it, we need 60 votes so we have to get the Democrats involved."
338	0	"They won’t vote, no matter what we do, they’re not going to vote."
339	0	"So we’re doing it a different way, a complex way."
340	0	It’s fine.
341	0	"The end result is when you have phase one, phase two, phase three — it’s going to be great."
342	0	It’s going to be great.
343	0	"And then, we get on to tax reductions, which I like."
344	0	(APPLAUSE)
345	0	The House legislation does so much for you.
346	0	It gives the states Medicaid flexibility.
347	0	And some of the states will take over their healthcare.
348	0	"Governor Rick Scott in Florida said, just send me the money — they run a great plan."
349	0	We have states that are doing great.
350	0	It gives great flexibility.
351	0	"Thank you, folks."
352	0	Thank you.
353	0	(APPLAUSE)
354	0	It repeals hundreds of billions of dollars in Obamacare taxes.
355	0	It provides tax credits to purchase the care that is rightfully theirs.
356	0	The bill that I will ultimately sign — and that will be a bill where everybody is going to get into the room and we’re going to get it done — we’ll get rid of Obamacare and make healthcare better for you and for your family.
357	0	(APPLAUSE)
358	0	"And once this is done, and a step further, we are going to try and put it in phase three — I’m going to work on bringing down the cost of medicine by having a fair and competitive bidding process."
359	0	(APPLAUSE)
360	0	"We welcome this healthcare debate and its negotiation, and we’re going to carry it out, and have been carrying it out, in the full light of day — unlike the way Obamacare was passed."
361	0	"Remember, folks, if we don’t do anything, Obamacare is gone."
362	0	"It’s not like, oh, gee, it’s going to be wonderful in three years."
363	0	It’s gone.
364	0	It’s gone.
365	0	It’s gone.
366	0	Not working.
367	0	It’s gone.
368	0	What we cannot do is to be intimidated by the dishonest attacks from Democratic leaders in Congress who broke the system in the first place and who don’t believe you should be able to make your own healthcare decisions.
369	0	(APPLAUSE)
370	0	"I am very confident that if we empower the American people we will accomplish incredible things for our country — not just on healthcare, but all across our government."
371	0	We will unlock new frontiers in science and in medicine.
372	0	"We will give our children the right to attend the school of their choice, one where they will be taught to love this country and its values."
373	0	(APPLAUSE)
374	0	"We will create millions and millions of new jobs by lowering taxes on our businesses, and very importantly for our workers, we’re going to lower taxes."
375	0	(APPLAUSE)
376	0	"And we will fight for the right of every American child to grow up in a safe neighborhood, attend a great school, and to graduate with access to a high-paying job that they love doing."
377	0	(APPLAUSE)
378	0	"No matter our background, no matter our income, no matter our geography, we all share the same home."
379	0	We all salute the same flag.
380	0	And we all are made by the same God.
381	0	(APPLAUSE)
382	0	USA!
383	0	USA!
384	0	USA!
385	0	It’s time to embrace our glorious American destiny.
386	0	Anything we can dream for our country we can achieve for our country.
387	0	All we have to do is tap into that American pride that is swelling our hearts and stirring our souls.
388	0	And we found that out very recently in our last election — a lot of pride.
389	0	(APPLAUSE)
390	0	"We are all Americans, and the future truly belongs to us."
391	0	The future belongs to all of you.
392	0	This is your moment.
393	0	This is your time.
394	0	This is the hour when history is made.
395	0	"All we have to do is put our own citizens first, and together we will make America strong again."
396	0	(APPLAUSE)
397	0	We will make America wealthy again.
398	0	We will make America proud again.
399	0	We will make America safe again.
400	0	And we will make America great again.
401	0	(APPLAUSE)
402	0	Thank you.
403	0	God bless you.
404	0	Thank you.
405	0	(APPLAUSE)
406	0	"God bless you, everybody."
407	0	(APPLAUSE)
1	0	Thank you very much.
2	0	(APPLAUSE)
3	0	Thank you.
4	0	I would like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila.
5	0	"We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time."
6	0	But it is really very sad as to what’s going on throughout the world with terror.
7	0	Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those affected.
8	1	"Before we discuss the Paris Accord, I’d like to begin with an update on our tremendous — absolutely tremendous — economic progress since Election Day on November 8th."
9	1	"The economy is starting to come back, and very, very rapidly."
10	1	"We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a million private sector jobs."
11	1	"I have just returned from a trip overseas where we concluded nearly $350 billion of military and economic development for the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs."
12	0	"It was a very, very successful trip, believe me."
13	0	(APPLAUSE)
14	0	Thank you.
15	0	Thank you.
16	0	"In my meetings at the G7, we have taken historic steps to demand fair and reciprocal trade that gives Americans a level playing field against other nations."
17	0	"We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians."
18	0	"Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you see that, you see it all over — from the previous administration, including getting many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror."
19	0	"Big, big contributions are being made by countries that weren’t doing so much in the form of contribution."
20	0	"One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American people during my campaign for President –- whether it’s cutting job-killing regulations; appointing and confirming a tremendous Supreme Court justice; putting in place tough new ethics rules; achieving a record reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border; or bringing jobs, plants, and factories back into the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible."
21	0	"And believe me, we’ve just begun."
22	0	The fruits of our labor will be seen very shortly even more so.
23	0	"On these issues and so many more, we’re following through on our commitments."
24	0	And I don’t want anything to get in our way.
25	0	I am fighting every day for the great people of this country.
26	0	"Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord —"
27	0	(APPLAUSE)
28	0	"— thank you, thank you — but begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris Accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers."
29	0	So we’re getting out.
30	0	"But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair."
31	0	"And if we can, that’s great."
32	0	"And if we can’t, that’s fine."
33	0	(APPLAUSE)
34	0	"As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of American citizens."
35	1	"The Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers — who I love — and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production."
36	1	"Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country."
37	0	"This includes ending the implementation of the nationally determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States a vast fortune."
38	1	Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates.
39	1	"This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs — not what we need — believe me, this is not what we need — including automobile jobs, and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely."
40	0	"They rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little."
41	1	"According to this same study, by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the previous administration would cut production for the following sectors:  paper down 12 percent; cement down 23 percent; iron and steel down 38 percent; coal — and I happen to love the coal miners — down 86 percent; natural gas down 31 percent."
42	1	"The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income and, in many cases, much worse than that."
43	0	"Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals."
44	1	"As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States — which is what it does -– the world’s leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world’s leading polluters."
45	1	"For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years — 13."
46	0	They can do whatever they want for 13 years.
47	0	Not us.
48	0	India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.
49	0	There are many other examples.
50	0	"But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States."
51	1	"Further, while the current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean coal in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up."
52	0	We’re having a big opening in two weeks.
53	0	"Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places."
54	0	A big opening of a brand-new mine.
55	0	It’s unheard of.
56	0	"For many, many years, that hasn’t happened."
57	0	They asked me if I’d go.
58	0	I’m going to try.
59	1	China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants.
60	1	"So we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement."
61	0	India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.
62	0	Think of it:  India can double their coal production.
63	0	We’re supposed to get rid of ours.
64	0	Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants.
65	0	"In short, the agreement doesn’t eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries."
66	0	This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States.
67	0	"The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris Agreement — they went wild; they were so happy — for the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage."
68	0	A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.
69	0	We would find it very hard to compete with other countries from other parts of the world.
70	0	"We have among the most abundant energy reserves on the planet, sufficient to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty."
71	0	"Yet, under this agreement, we are effectively putting these reserves under lock and key, taking away the great wealth of our nation — it’s great wealth, it’s phenomenal wealth; not so long ago, we had no idea we had such wealth — and leaving millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness."
72	0	The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.
73	0	"At 1 percent growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our domestic demand, but at 3 or 4 percent growth, which I expect, we need all forms of available American energy, or our country —"
74	0	(APPLAUSE)
75	0	"— will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life."
76	0	"Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree — think of that; this much — Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100."
77	0	"Tiny, tiny amount."
78	0	"In fact, 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone would wipe out the gains from America — and this is an incredible statistic — would totally wipe out the gains from America’s expected reductions in the year 2030, after we have had to spend billions and billions of dollars, lost jobs, closed factories, and suffered much higher energy costs for our businesses and for our homes."
79	0	"As the Wall Street Journal wrote this morning:  ""The reality is that withdrawing is in America’s economic interest and won’t matter much to the climate."""
80	0	"The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth."
81	0	We’ll be the cleanest.
82	0	We’re going to have the cleanest air.
83	0	We’re going to have the cleanest water.
84	0	"We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to lose our jobs."
85	0	We’re going to grow; we’re going to grow rapidly.
86	0	(APPLAUSE)
87	0	"And I think you just read — it just came out minutes ago, the small business report — small businesses as of just now are booming, hiring people."
88	0	One of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.
89	0	"I’m willing to immediately work with Democratic leaders to either negotiate our way back into Paris, under the terms that are fair to the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers."
90	0	(APPLAUSE)
91	0	"So if the obstructionists want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists."
92	0	"We will all sit down, and we will get back into the deal."
93	0	"And we’ll make it good, and we won’t be closing up our factories, and we won’t be losing our jobs."
94	0	And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris Accord or something that we can do that’s much better than the Paris Accord.
95	0	"And I think the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of the world will be thrilled."
96	0	"But until we do that, we’re out of the agreement."
97	0	"I will work to ensure that America remains the world’s leader on environmental issues, but under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and responsibilities are equally shared among the many nations all around the world."
98	0	No responsible leader can put the workers — and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.
99	0	"The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, while empowering some of the world’s top polluting countries, should dispel any doubt as to the real reason why foreign lobbyists wish to keep our magnificent country tied up and bound down by this agreement:  It’s to give their country an economic edge over the United States."
100	0	That’s not going to happen while I’m President.
101	0	I’m sorry.
102	0	(APPLAUSE)
103	0	"My job as President is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field and to create the economic, regulatory and tax structures that make America the most prosperous and productive country on Earth, and with the highest standard of living and the highest standard of environmental protection."
104	0	"Our tax bill is moving along in Congress, and I believe it’s doing very well."
105	0	I think a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.
106	0	"The Republicans are working very, very hard."
107	0	"We’d love to have support from the Democrats, but we may have to go it alone."
108	0	But it’s going very well.
109	0	The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country’s expense.
110	0	They don’t put America first.
111	0	"I do, and I always will."
112	0	(APPLAUSE)
113	0	"The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance."
114	0	You see what’s happening.
115	0	It’s pretty obvious to those that want to keep an open mind.
116	0	At what point does America get demeaned?
117	0	At what point do they start laughing at us as a country?
118	0	"We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers."
119	0	We don’t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore.
120	0	And they won’t be.
121	0	They won’t be.
122	0	"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris."
123	0	(APPLAUSE)
124	0	I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America’s interests.
125	0	Many trade deals will soon be under renegotiation.
126	0	"Very rarely do we have a deal that works for this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation."
127	0	The process has begun from day one.
128	0	But now we’re down to business.
129	0	"Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund — nice name — which calls for developed countries to send $100 billion to developing countries all on top of America’s existing and massive foreign aid payments."
130	0	"So we’re going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else."
131	0	"Many of the other countries haven’t spent anything, and many of them will never pay one dime."
132	0	The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United States has already handed over $1 billion — nobody else is even close; most of them haven’t even paid anything — including funds raided out of America’s budget for the war against terrorism.
133	0	That’s where they came.
134	0	"Believe me, they didn’t come from me."
135	0	They came just before I came into office.
136	0	Not good.
137	0	And not good the way they took the money.
138	0	"In 2015, the United Nation’s departing top climate officials reportedly described the $100 billion per year as ""peanuts,"" and stated that ""the $100 billion is the tail that wags the dog."""
139	0	"In 2015, the Green Climate Fund’s executive director reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would increase to $450 billion per year after 2020."
140	1	And nobody even knows where the money is going to.
141	1	"Nobody has been able to say, where is it going to?"
142	0	"Of course, the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated."
143	0	America is $20 trillion in debt.
144	0	Cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers or fix vital infrastructure.
145	0	Millions of our citizens are out of work.
146	0	"And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us."
147	0	So think of that.
148	0	There are serious legal and constitutional issues as well.
149	0	"Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the world should not have more to say with respect to the U.S. economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives."
150	0	"Thus, our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America’s sovereignty."
151	0	(APPLAUSE)
152	0	"Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it."
153	0	And I will.
154	0	"Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States as we begin the process of unlocking the restrictions on America’s abundant energy reserves, which we have started very strongly."
155	0	"It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the new reality we face if we do not leave the agreement or if we do not negotiate a far better deal."
156	0	The risks grow as historically these agreements only tend to become more and more ambitious over time.
157	0	"In other words, the Paris framework is a starting point — as bad as it is — not an end point."
158	1	And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability.
159	1	"Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in."
160	0	"As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people."
161	0	"The Paris Accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risks, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world."
162	0	It is time to exit the Paris Accord —
163	0	(APPLAUSE)
164	0	"— and time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country."
165	0	"It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania — along with many, many other locations within our great country — before Paris, France."
166	0	It is time to make America great again.
167	0	(APPLAUSE)
168	0	Thank you.
169	0	Thank you.
170	0	Thank you very much.
171	0	Thank you very much.
172	0	Very important.
173	0	"I’d like to ask Scott Pruitt, who most of you know and respect, as I do, just to say a few words."
1	0	Thank you very much.
2	0	You just want massive tax cuts.
3	0	That’s what you want.
4	0	That’s the only reason you’re going so wild.
5	0	(APPLAUSE)
6	0	But it’s wonderful to be back in the great state of Indiana.
7	0	What a place.
8	0	(APPLAUSE)
9	0	"I want to thank Senator Todd Young, Senator Joe Donnelly, Representative Jackie Walorski, Representative Susan Brooks, and Representative Mike [sic] Messer for joining us today."
10	0	Thank you very much.
11	0	Thank you very much for being here.
12	0	Appreciate it.
13	0	(APPLAUSE)
14	0	"I also want to thank members of my economic team, Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Director Gary Cohn, for joining us, as well."
15	0	We appreciate it.
16	0	(APPLAUSE)
17	0	Let me begin by saying that our hearts and prayers go out to the people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands who are suffering in the wake of yet another catastrophic hurricane.
18	0	"I mean, their island was virtually destroyed."
19	0	Federal agencies are working closely with local partners to help these communities get back on their feet as soon as possible.
20	0	"Texas, Florida, and Louisiana are doing great, and the recovery process is happening very, very quickly."
21	0	I will be going down to Puerto Rico next week to get an on-the-ground briefing about the disaster recovery and to see all of our great first responders and to meet a lot of the people who were so affected by these storms.
22	0	"We are with you now, I tell them, and we will be there every step of the way until this job is done."
23	0	It is truly catastrophic what happened in Puerto Rico.
24	0	(APPLAUSE)
25	0	"And massive amounts of water, food, and supplies, by the way, are being delivered on an hourly basis."
26	0	"It’s something that nobody has ever seen before from this country, I can tell you that."
27	0	"And I’m very proud of all of the folks that have worked so hard in FEMA, all of our first responders, all of our police that have gone to the island because their police force has been so badly affected."
28	0	"And many of their policemen — in fact, most of the police people have lost their homes, and it’s been a tough go."
29	0	But we are — we’re going to get it back.
30	0	"Before we go on to discuss the largest tax cut in our county’s history, I also want to provide a brief update on healthcare."
31	1	We have the votes on Graham-Cassidy.
32	0	"But with the rules of reconciliation, we’re up against a deadline of Friday — two days."
33	0	That’s just two days.
34	0	"And yes-vote senator — we have a wonderful senator, great, great senator — who is a yes vote, but he’s home recovering from a pretty tough situation."
35	0	"And with so many great features, including all of the block granting, the money to the states, et cetera, et cetera, our healthcare plan is really going to be something excellent."
36	0	It’s going to be better managed for the people that it serves.
37	0	"Having local healthcare representatives is far better than having healthcare managed from Washington, D.C."
38	0	Not even a contest.
39	0	(APPLAUSE)
40	0	"And many, many governors, as you also see, have agreed with us and approved it and really look forward to running it properly."
41	0	"But again, because the reconciliation window is about to close, we have to wait a few months until it reopens before we take a vote."
42	0	So we’re getting all of the good signs from Alaska and the others to repeal and replace Obamacare.
43	0	"And I was hoping this would be put on my desk right after we won the election, and I’d come in and sign."
44	0	But it didn’t work that way.
45	0	There were a couple of people that — I won’t say anything.
46	0	(LAUGHTER)
47	0	"But early next year when reconciliation kicks back in, in any event long before the November election, we’re going to have a vote."
48	0	"And we’re going to be able to get that through, and I think we’ll actually get it through very easily and the time makes it easier."
49	0	"But speaking of reconciliation, the Republican Senate needs to get rid of the filibuster rule, which is blocking so many great legislative reforms the American people badly want and deserve."
50	0	"By the way, the Democrats, if they had the opportunity, which hopefully they won’t for many, many years, they would get rid of it on day one."
51	0	And most of you know exactly what I’m talking about.
52	0	We’re here today in Indiana to announce our framework to deliver historic tax relief to the American People.
53	0	(APPLAUSE)
54	0	"This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and I guess it’s probably something I can say that I’m very good at."
55	0	I’ve been waiting for this for a long time.
56	0	"We’re going to cut taxes for the middle class, make the tax code simpler and more fair for everyday Americans, and we are going to bring back the jobs and wealth that have left our country — and most people thought left our country for good."
57	0	(APPLAUSE)
58	0	"We want tax reform that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family, and, yes, tax reform that is pro-American."
59	0	(APPLAUSE)
60	0	"It’s time to take care of our people, to rebuild our nation, and to fight for our great American workers."
61	0	(APPLAUSE)
62	0	Indiana is a tremendous example of the prosperity that is unleashed when we cut taxes and set free the dreams of our citizens.
63	0	This state has claimed a powerful competitive edge built on low taxes and less regulation — and are we cutting regulation?
64	0	(APPLAUSE)
65	0	And businesses all across the country have taken notice.
66	1	"In recent years, Indiana has welcomed dozens of companies fleeing high taxes and high-tax states."
67	1	Thousands of new jobs and massive capital investment have followed — meaning a better quality of life for the people of Indiana.
68	0	All of this is possible because the people of this state have made a decision. They chose to make Indiana competitive again.
69	0	"They chose, and their choice was so important."
70	0	"It included electing a governor, who you may have heard of"
71	0	(LAUGHTER)
72	0	"— who signed the largest income tax cut in the state’s history, our very, very terrific person and terrific Vice President, Mike Pence."
73	0	(APPLAUSE)
74	0	It’s time for Washington to learn from the wisdom of Indiana.
75	0	We need Washington to promote American jobs instead of obstructing them.
76	0	That is what I have been working to achieve every day since I took office.
77	0	That is what I talked about on the campaign trail.
78	0	"Already, we’re seeing the results of an economic policy that finally puts America first."
79	0	(APPLAUSE)
80	1	Unemployment is at a 16-year low.
81	1	Unemployment for African Americans is near its lowest point since the turn of the millennium.
82	0	It’s really a fantastic thing to see.
83	0	(APPLAUSE)
84	1	Wages are rising.
85	0	Optimism among manufacturers has reached all-time highs.
86	1	GDP growth last quarter reached 3 percent way ahead of schedule; nobody thought that was going to happen for a long time.
87	0	(APPLAUSE)
88	0	"And this quarter, I believe, would have been better, but the hurricanes will have an impact."
89	0	"But other than that, it would have been, in my opinion, even better."
90	0	"Your government is working for you once again, not for the donors, not the special interests, but the hardworking taxpaying citizens of our country."
91	0	(APPLAUSE)
92	0	America is back on the right track.
93	0	And I see so many red hats — Make America Great Again.
94	0	That’s what we’re doing — Make America Great Again.
95	0	(APPLAUSE)
96	0	"But our country and our economy cannot take off like they should unless we dramatically reform America’s outdated, complex, and extremely burdensome tax code."
97	0	It’s a relic.
98	0	We’ve got to change it.
99	0	We have to compete — compete with other countries.
100	0	The current tax system is a colossal barrier standing in the way of America’s economic comeback because it can be far greater than it’s ever been.
101	0	"But we’re going to remove that barrier to create the tax system our people finally, finally, finally — and want and deserve."
102	0	"For several months, my administration has been working closely with Congress to develop a framework for tax reform."
103	0	"Over the next few months, the House and Senate will build on this framework and produce legislation that will deliver more jobs, higher pay, and lower taxes for middle-class families — for the working man and woman — and for businesses of all sizes."
104	0	I look forward
105	0	(APPLAUSE)
106	0	Thank you.
107	0	I look forward to working with Congress to deliver these historic tax cuts and reforms to the American people.
108	0	These tax cuts are significant.
109	0	There’s never been tax cuts like what we’re talking about.
110	0	Our framework is based on four key ideas:
111	0	"First, we will cut taxes for the everyday, hardworking Americans — the people that work so long, so hard, and they’ve been forgotten."
112	0	But they’re not forgotten anymore.
113	0	I think we proved that on November 8th.
114	0	(APPLAUSE)
115	0	"Under this framework, the first $12,000 of income earned by a single individual will be tax free,"
116	0	(APPLAUSE)
117	0	"- and a married couple won’t pay a dime in taxes on their first $24,000 of income."
118	0	"So, a married couple — up to $24,000 — can spend their money on their family, on their children, on what they have to do."
119	0	So much better.
120	0	"In other words, more income for more people will be taxed at a rate of zero."
121	0	(APPLAUSE)
122	0	"At this zero percent rate, taxable income will be subject to just three tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent."
123	0	Jonathan Blanton and his wife Jamie from Greentown are here with us today.
124	0	Where are they?
125	0	"Oh, hello, Jonathan."
126	0	How are you?
127	0	(APPLAUSE)
128	0	Jonathan does industrial janitorial work and Jamie works at an auto company.
129	0	"Together they’re raising four beautiful children, and last year they earned less than $90,000."
130	0	"Under our tax plan they would have saved more than $1,000, and it could be substantially more."
131	0	And that’s just on federal taxes.
132	0	"So they would have saved at least $1,000."
133	0	"Middle-income families will save even more money with an increased child tax credit for children under the age of 17, which so many families have been calling for."
134	0	(APPLAUSE)
135	0	We will eliminate the marriage penalty in the existing credit and expand eligibility to include even more middle-income families.
136	0	Greatly expanded.
137	0	We’re also expanding the child tax credit because we believe the most important investment our country can make is in our children.
138	0	(APPLAUSE)
139	0	And this is just one more critical way that we’re targeting relief to working families.
140	0	"In addition, under our framework, those caring for the elderly loved — and we love these people, but we’re caring, and we take such care of the elderly and other adult dependents — will receive financial relief in the form of a $500 tax credit."
141	0	(APPLAUSE)
142	0	We’re doing everything we can to reduce the tax burden on you and your family.
143	0	"By eliminating tax breaks and loopholes, we will ensure that the benefits are focused on the middle class, the working men and women, not the highest-income earners."
144	0	(APPLAUSE)
145	1	"Our framework includes our explicit commitment that tax reform will protect low-income and middle-income households, not the wealthy and well-connected."
146	0	They can call me all they want.
147	0	It’s not going to help.
148	1	"I’m doing the right thing, and it’s not good for me."
149	0	Believe me.
150	0	(APPLAUSE)
151	0	"But what is good for me — not only as President and legacy — what is good for me is if everything takes off like a rocket ship, like it should have for 20 years."
152	0	That’s good for me.
153	0	That’s good for everyone.
154	0	(APPLAUSE)
155	0	And that’s what I think is going to happen.
156	0	(APPLAUSE)
157	0	"And a lot of very wealthy people feel the same way, believe me."
158	0	"In fact, we are eliminating most itemized deductions that primarily benefit the wealthiest taxpayers."
159	0	We’ve also given Congress the flexibility to add an additional top rate on the very highest income earners to provide even more tax relief for working people.
160	0	"Second, our framework will make the tax code simple, fair, and easy to understand, finally."
161	0	(APPLAUSE)
162	0	Americans waste money.
163	0	Americans waste so much money — billions and billions of dollars and many hours each year to comply with our ridiculously complex tax code.
164	1	More than 90 percent of Americans use assistance to prepare their taxes.
165	0	"Under our framework, the vast majority of families will be able to file their taxes on a single sheet of paper."
166	0	(APPLAUSE)
167	0	"We are also repealing the alternative minimum tax, or AMT."
168	0	About time.
169	0	(APPLAUSE)
170	0	The AMT is actually a shadow tax system that requires many people to calculate their taxes two different ways and pay the higher of the two amounts.
171	0	You’re all familiar with it.
172	0	"Under our framework, the AMT will make even less sense because we are repealing many of the special interest tax breaks that it was designed to deal with."
173	0	We are making our taxes simple again.
174	0	We are simplifying our tax system.
175	1	"To protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer, we are finally ending the crushing, the horrible, the unfair estate tax, or as it is often referred to, the death tax."
176	0	(APPLAUSE)
177	0	"That means, especially for all of you with small businesses that are really tremendous businesses, you’ll be able to leave them to your family, and your family won’t have to run out and do a fire sale to try and get the money to pay the tax — lose the business, ends up going out of business."
178	0	All of those jobs are lost.
179	1	The farmers in particular are affected.
180	1	"They have wonderful farms, but they can’t pay the tax, so they have to sell the farm."
181	0	The people that buy it don’t run it with love.
182	0	"They can’t run it the same way, and it goes out."
183	1	So that death tax is a disaster for this country and a disaster for so many small businesses and farmers.
184	0	And we’re getting rid of it.
185	0	(APPLAUSE)
186	0	"Now if you don’t like your family, it won’t matter, okay?"
187	0	(LAUGHTER)
188	0	"But for those that love your family, it matters a lot."
189	0	(LAUGHTER)
190	0	"With us today is Kip Tom, a family farmer from Leesburg — Where’s Kip?"
191	0	"Go ahead, Kip."
192	0	"Hi, Kip"
193	0	(APPLAUSE)
194	0	 who fears that his family’s farming heritage — it’s been a long time.
195	0	"How long, Kip?"
196	0	"A hundred and eighty-seven years — that’s peanuts, Kip."
197	0	(APPLAUSE)
198	0	Wow.
199	0	That’s a long time.
200	1	"But that great heritage could come to an end because of the death tax, or the estate tax, and could make it impossible for him to pass that legacy to his wonderful family."
201	0	We’re not going to let that happen.
202	0	"We are not going to allow the death tax to steal away the American Dream from these great, great families, many of which are in this room today."
203	0	(APPLAUSE)
204	0	"We will protect our farmers, our ranchers, and our small businesses, and we will make taxes simple, easy, and fair for all Americans."
205	0	Okay?
206	0	(APPLAUSE)
207	0	"Third, we will cut taxes on American businesses to restore our competitive edge and create more jobs and higher wages for American workers."
208	0	(APPLAUSE)
209	0	"In Indiana, you have seen firsthand that cutting taxes on businesses makes your state more competitive and leads to more jobs and higher paychecks for your workers."
210	0	"Now, we want to do the same thing for America, making our country more competitive with other nations."
211	0	"And in many cases, those other nations are taking advantage of us in so many ways."
212	0	"They say they’re friends, and perhaps they are, but believe me, I am renegotiating our trade deals, including NAFTA, including many other trade deals."
213	0	(APPLAUSE)
214	0	"And through regulation, all you have to do is look at the massive pipelines — Dakota Access."
215	0	"You take a look, 48,000 jobs immediately approved."
216	0	So we’re letting that happen.
217	0	"But in terms of the tax and the tax strategy that Ronald Reagan used to create an economic boom in the 1980s: When our economy took off, the middle class thrived, and the family income of all families was increasing more and more."
218	0	And it was a beautiful sight to behold.
219	0	"Since then, other nations have adopted, unfortunately, our playbook and ran it even better than we did."
220	0	"And I shouldn’t say even better because we didn’t run it well at all, and we let other nations come in and take advantage of us and take our jobs away and take our businesses out."
221	0	"And we’re stopping that, and you see it right here what we’ve done."
222	1	"Today, our total business tax rate is 60 percent higher than our average foreign competitor in the developed world."
223	0	That’s not good.
224	0	"We have surrendered our competitive edge to other countries, but we’re not surrendering anymore."
225	0	We’re not surrendering anymore.
226	0	"Under our framework, we will dramatically cut the business tax rate so that American companies and American workers can beat our foreign competitors and start winning again."
227	0	(APPLAUSE)
228	0	We will reduce the corporate tax rate to no higher than 20 percent.
229	0	That’s way down from 35 and 39
230	0	(APPLAUSE)
231	0	which is substantially below the average of other industrialized nations.
232	0	"This is a revolutionary change, and the biggest winners will be the everyday American workers as jobs start pouring into our country, as companies start competing for American labor, and as wages start going up at levels that you haven’t seen in many years."
233	0	(APPLAUSE)
234	0	"When our companies move to other countries, it’s our loyal American workers who get hurt."
235	0	"And when companies stay in America, and come to America, it’s our wonderful workers who reap the rewards."
236	0	"And I just left the United Nations last week, and I was told by one of the most powerful leaders of the world that they’re going to be announcing, in the not-too-distant future, five major factories in the United States — between increasing and new — five."
237	0	(APPLAUSE)
238	0	You’ll be hearing about that very soon.
239	0	"And I said thank you very much, and he said, “you know what?"
240	0	It’s starting to happen in the United States.
241	0	It’s starting to happen.”
242	0	So I just wanted to let you know that.
243	0	I promised I wouldn’t say who.
244	0	I’ll keep my word.
245	0	Okay?
246	0	(LAUGHTER)
247	0	Unless you force me.
248	0	(LAUGHTER)
249	0	MEMBERS Who?
250	0	Members of both parties — it happens to be in the automobile industry.
251	0	That’s a good industry.
252	0	(LAUGHTER)
253	0	Members of both parties should agree that we need a tax code that keeps jobs in our country and brings jobs back to our country.
254	0	(APPLAUSE)
255	0	"And for the millions of small businesses and farms that file their taxes as sole proprietors, S corporations or partnerships, we will cap the tax rate they pay at 25 percent — much lower."
256	0	Big difference.
257	0	(APPLAUSE)
258	0	This will be the lowest top marginal income tax rate for small and mid-size businesses in this country in more than 80 years.
259	0	(APPLAUSE)
260	0	"To give businesses even more reason to boost their investment in America, for the next five years, our framework will allow to fully write off — listen to this — the cost of equipment in the year they buy it."
261	0	That is big.
262	0	(APPLAUSE)
263	0	And that’s instead of having to take deductions and deduct the cost over a long period of time.
264	0	Now that’s called incentive.
265	0	That’s called incentive.
266	0	(APPLAUSE)
267	0	This will be tremendously important to help American businesses afford the heavy industrial machinery and other capital investments they need to grow big and grow strong.
268	0	"Joining us today is John Gannon, the owner of a custom wood fencing and deck construction company in Indianapolis."
269	0	"John is the father of nine children, and recently celebrated his 35th wedding anniversary."
270	0	"Congratulations, John."
271	0	(APPLAUSE)
272	0	"And John is in the fencing company, as you heard, and I’m just thinking — I have to mention this — you know, we have a fence around the White House."
273	0	(LAUGHTER)
274	0	"We have a fence around the White House, and they want to build a new fence."
275	0	"And I figured, you know — I’m pretty good at construction — I figured, I don’t know, maybe a million, maybe a million-and-a-half."
276	0	And this has been taking place over a long period of time — previous administrations.
277	0	"So I said, “how much is the fence you’re talking around the White House?”"
278	0	"“Sir, the fence will cost approximately $50 million.”"
279	0	"I said, “What?”"
280	0	(LAUGHTER)
281	0	"I kid you not, and we have thousands of things like that."
282	0	Thousands.
283	0	"We’re going to get it all down, but think of that: $50 million."
284	0	"Now, I assume it’s a strong fence."
285	0	(LAUGHTER)
286	0	Okay?
287	0	"So, John, do you think you could do it for slightly less than $50 million?"
288	0	I think he could take $49 off right now and he’d have plenty of profit.
289	0	Right?
290	0	"Right, John?"
291	0	It’s crazy.
292	0	(APPLAUSE)
293	0	It’s crazy.
294	0	"Never understand it, but we’re working on it."
295	0	"John says that a tax cut like we’re proposing will make his business more competitive, allowing him to expand, hire more workers, and raise wages for his current employees."
296	0	"Right, John?"
297	0	"Also with us is Aaron Williams, a father of two who works in the field of information technology."
298	0	Where’s Aaron?
299	0	"Hello, Aaron."
300	0	Hi.
301	0	(APPLAUSE)
302	0	It’s a good field.
303	0	"Aaron has seen the disastrous effects of high — and just literally, high corporate tax rates right up close and personal, as more and more high-tech jobs are shipped overseas."
304	0	"You’ve been watching it, Aaron."
305	0	Right?
306	0	All over.
307	0	"Like millions of other Americans, Aaron wants to bring those jobs back to the United States."
308	0	"We’re going to reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they can keep jobs in America, Aaron; create jobs in America; compete for workers in America; and raise wages right here in America."
309	0	You’re going to be in a much different position.
310	0	Okay?
311	0	(APPLAUSE)
312	0	Thank you.
313	0	Tremendous incentives.
314	0	We want more products proudly stamped with those four beautiful words: Made in the USA.
315	0	Right?
316	0	(APPLAUSE)
317	0	Made in the USA.
318	0	"Finally, our framework encourages American companies to bring back the trillions and trillions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas."
319	0	Our current tax system
320	0	(APPLAUSE)
321	0	— trillions.
322	0	"And by the way, for years I’ve been hearing it’s 2.5 trillion."
323	0	"So I’ve been hearing this for about five years, so I assume it’s much more."
324	0	Right?
325	0	"But Democrats want to do it, and Republicans want to do it."
326	0	For years — who doesn’t want to do it?
327	0	"They want to bring — but they can’t do it because it’s so restrictive, and the taxes are so ridiculous."
328	0	So they can’t do it.
329	0	"So the money stays in other countries, and it’s invested in other countries."
330	0	We want to bring it back.
331	0	"But think of it, it’s one of the few things — Democrats want it and Republicans want it."
332	0	"So they both want it, and yet for years they haven’t been able to do it."
333	0	Now we’re doing it.
334	0	We’re doing things.
335	0	(APPLAUSE)
336	0	"You know, it’s one thing when we want a healthcare and they want a healthcare, and there’s a dispute."
337	0	But here’s something everybody wants and they can’t do it.
338	0	"So you can tell you, there’s a broken system in D.C., but we’re getting it fixed rather — I think — rather rapidly."
339	0	You’ll be seeing that over the next few months.
340	0	Our current tax system makes us one of the few developed nations in the world to punish our companies when they bring wealth earned overseas back into our country.
341	0	We’re punishing them for bringing the money back in.
342	0	"As a result, corporations have parked many trillions of dollars in foreign countries, and many have incorporated abroad in order to avoid our punitive tax system altogether."
343	0	"And some companies actually leave our country because they have so much money overseas — so much, it’s an incredible amount — that they move the company to get their money."
344	0	We’re going to let them bring the money back home.
345	0	(APPLAUSE)
346	0	Our framework will stop punishing companies for keeping their headquarters in the United States.
347	0	We’re punishing companies under our codes for being in the United States.
348	0	We will impose a one-time low tax on returning money that is already offshore so that it can be brought back home to America where it belongs and where it can be put to work and work and work.
349	0	(APPLAUSE)
350	0	"The framework I’ve just described represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reduce taxes, rebuild our economy, and restore America’s competitive edge."
351	0	Finally.
352	0	(APPLAUSE)
353	0	"And I have to say, just before coming here we released some of the details of the tax and the tax reform and the tax cuts, and it has really received tremendous, tremendous reviews."
354	0	"And if Senator Donnelly doesn’t approve it, because you know he’s on the other side, we will come here."
355	0	We will campaign against him like you wouldn’t believe.
356	0	(APPLAUSE)
357	0	I think they’re going to approve it.
358	0	"I think we’ll have — actually, I think we’ll have numerous Democrats come across because it’s the right thing to do."
359	0	These reforms will be a dramatic change from a failed tax system that encourages American businesses to ship jobs to foreign countries that have much lower tax rates.
360	0	It’s what we can’t do.
361	0	Our competitors have much lower tax rates.
362	0	But no longer.
363	0	"My administration strongly rejects this offshoring model, and we have embraced the new model."
364	0	It’s called — the American model.
365	0	(APPLAUSE)
366	0	"Under the American model, we are reducing burdens on our businesses as long as they do business in our country."
367	0	That’s what we want.
368	0	"We want them to do business in our country, not to leave our country like a number of firms from Indiana."
369	0	"Some made some great promises to me, but those promises are only being partially kept because they’re incentivized to leave."
370	0	But now they’re going to be incentivized to stay.
371	0	"And if that doesn’t work, then we’ll get even tougher than that."
372	0	Okay?
373	0	"We want our companies to hire and grow in America and to raise wages for American workers, and to help rebuild American cities and towns."
374	0	(APPLAUSE)
375	0	"That is how we will all succeed together and grow together as one team, one people, and one American family."
376	0	We want it to happen here.
377	0	(APPLAUSE)
378	0	"Tax reform has not historically been a partisan issue, and it does not have to be a partisan issue today."
379	0	I really believe we’re going to have numerous Democrats come over and sign because it’s the right thing to do.
380	0	"I believe that it’s the right thing to do, and I know many of them."
381	0	And they’re telling me it is the right thing to do.
382	0	President Reagan’s tax cuts were passed with significant bipartisan majorities at a time when there was a Democrat majority in the House and a Democrat Speaker — Tip O’Neill.
383	0	"Before that, Democrat President John F. Kennedy championed tax cuts that surged the economy and massively reduced unemployment."
384	0	"As President Kennedy very wisely said, “The single most important fiscal weapon available to strengthen the national economy is the federal tax policy. The right kind of tax cut at the right time” — at the right time, this is the right time — “is the most effective measure that this government could take to spur our economy forward.”"
385	0	That was President Kennedy.
386	0	(APPLAUSE)
387	0	"My fellow Americans, this is the right tax cut, and this is the right time."
388	0	"Democrats and Republicans in Congress should come together, finally, to deliver this giant win for the American people and begin middle-class miracle — it’s called a middle-class miracle, once again."
389	0	"It’s also called a miracle for our great companies; a miracle for the middle class, for the working person."
390	0	"I truly believe that many Democrats want to support our plan, and with enough encouragement from the American people, they will find the courage to do what is right for our great country."
391	0	(APPLAUSE)
392	0	"But they’ll only do it if you, the American people, make your voices heard."
393	0	Only if you tell Congress to give us a tax code that puts American jobs first.
394	0	And that’s what we’re doing.
395	0	(APPLAUSE)
396	0	History has proven time and time again that there is no power on Earth more awesome than the will of the American people.
397	0	"That is why today I am asking all Americans — Republican, Democrat, independent — to join with me, and with each other to demand tax reform that will truly, truly, truly make America great again."
398	0	(APPLAUSE)
399	0	Call your congressmen.
400	0	Call your senators.
401	0	Let them know you’re watching.
402	0	Let them know you’re waiting.
403	0	Tell them that today is the day for decision.
404	0	That now is the time to heal this self-inflicted economic wound.
405	0	"And that with their action, the future will belong to all of us."
406	0	"If you demand it, the politicians will listen."
407	0	"They will answer, and they will act."
408	0	"And someday, many years from now, our children and our grandchildren will remember this moment in history as the time when ordinary Americans took control of their destiny and chose a future of American patriotism, prosperity, and pride."
409	0	(APPLAUSE)
410	0	"With your help and your voice, we will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our wealth, and for every citizen across this land, we will bring back our great American dreams."
411	0	"Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America."
412	0	(APPLAUSE)
1	0	Welcome to all of you deplorables.
2	0	"Thank you, ma’am."
3	0	"Boy, oh boy."
4	0	We’re going to have a good time tonight.
5	0	We’re going to have a good time.
6	0	Wow.
7	0	I love that.
8	0	I love that.
9	0	Look at this.
10	0	Look what that says.
11	0	Hold up that sign for the cameras.
12	0	Wow.
13	0	That’s so beautiful.
14	0	Thank you.
15	0	Great.
16	0	Thank you.
17	0	That is so nice.
18	0	And we are doing well in every way.
19	0	The polls have been incredible.
20	0	But we’re doing great.
21	0	It’s great to be in my second home — Florida.
22	0	"And in the city of Miami, where I have so many wonderful friends and projects and employees."
23	0	We have an amazing group.
24	0	And all of you know Trump National Doral and we’ll go there.
25	0	Let’s go and have some fun.
26	0	"We have tremendous developments in Miami on the water and Doral in particular has been a tremendous, tremendous thing."
27	0	So I really appreciate it.
28	0	I love this city.
29	0	I love the whole state.
30	0	"So, and I have a lot of employees."
31	0	And I’m paying them a lot of money.
32	0	"And, by the way, a lot of African-American employees, a lot of Hispanic employees."
33	0	A lot.
34	0	And they’re very happy.
35	0	They like Donald Trump.
36	0	So new polls have just come in.
37	0	And we’re leading in many of the battleground states all over the country.
38	0	Including being 4 points up in a certain state known as Florida.
39	1	And the Los Angeles Times has us 6 points up nationwide.
40	0	Good poll.
41	0	"If it weren’t, I wouldn’t be telling you about it, I promise."
42	0	"But come Nov. 8, we’re going to win Florida, and we’re going to win the White House, and we’re going to make America great again."
43	0	It’s going to be a victory for the people.
44	0	"It’s going to be a victory for the workers, the families, the veterans."
45	0	The veterans — we love our veterans.
46	0	And every citizen of this country.
47	0	It’s going to be a victory for those who haven’t had reason to hope for a very long time.
48	0	"I’m campaigning in every community, every part of this country for every last vote."
49	0	I’m running to be a president for all Americans.
50	0	I just had the most amazing afternoon in Little Haiti.
51	0	Good place.
52	0	Unbelievable people.

56	0	All of them.
57	0	"And, by the way, at Little Haiti they presented me with something that I figured I’d put on."
58	0	Is that OK to put it on?
59	0	They gave me that and I love it.
60	0	I think it’s great.
61	0	Your cops and soldiers — thank you.
62	0	I love you too.
63	0	"Carpenters and welders, accountants and lawyers, young and old, rich and poor, Black, white and Hispanic."
64	0	"But above all, we are together and we are Americans."
65	0	We got to pull our country together.
66	0	"Just today I was honored to get the endorsement of recipients of the Medal of Honor, brave people."
67	0	"And many, many of our most amazing military leaders, generals, admirals, amazing people, real fighters."
68	0	They really know what they’re doing.
69	0	We now have the endorsements of more than 160 top generals and admirals.
70	0	I didn’t know we had that many.
71	0	"Well, we love them."
72	0	"We also have the support of 16,500 border patrol officers."
73	0	The first time in the history of the border patrol that they’ve endorsed any presidential candidate.
74	0	"As well as law enforcement officers, police, all across the country."
75	0	"In fact, I’m very excited to announce tonight that we just received a few minutes ago the endorsement of the largest police union in the country, the Fraternal Order of Police."
76	0	Number one by far.
77	0	Pretty good.
78	0	Pretty good.
79	0	And we have the support of millions of patriotic moms and dads who go to work every day and make our country run.
80	0	While my opponent slanders you as deplorable — and irredeemable!
81	0	Boy that second word is tough.
82	0	You don’t hear that as much.
83	0	"But that means you’re never going to come back, folks."
84	0	And I know you’re going to come back.
85	0	We’re going to come back so strong.
86	0	We’re going to be so strong.
87	0	Stronger than ever before.
88	0	Irredeemable.
89	0	"They don’t talk about that one, but that was, to me, pretty bad."
90	0	"I call you hardworking American patriots who love your family and really, really, really love your country."
91	0	Love your country.
92	0	"Clinton’s entire campaign rests on using a single tactic, and it’s not working very well."
93	0	She spent hundreds of millions of dollars on phony campaign ads.
94	0	And we’re actually I think probably leading — based on everything we’re seeing — and we’ve spent practically nothing.
95	0	I’m proud of that.
96	0	And you know what?
97	0	We’re doing very well.
98	0	You know in the old days if you spent less and you had far fewer people and you were leading you got credit.
99	0	"Today they say well, she’s spending much more money."
100	0	"Yes, but she’s doing poorly, very poorly."
101	0	But what they do is they smear opponents — and you look at her history — and they question policies.
102	0	"And they talk all the time about racist, racist."
103	0	It’s the only word they know.
104	0	They used it on Romney.
105	0	They used it on everybody.
106	0	They use it.
107	0	"When they’re in trouble, they always pull out the racist word."
108	0	"And they are in very big trouble, I have to tell you."
109	1	And for the most part we haven’t even started spending our money yet.
110	0	And we have raised a lot of money.
111	0	And I’m putting in my money.
112	0	And I put in a hell of a lot of money.
113	0	"In fact, if things don’t work out, even though a lot of people are saying this was one of the great political phenomenas they’ve ever seen."
114	0	They’ve never seen — they call it a phenomena.
115	0	I will tell you.
116	0	"If it doesn’t work out, it will be a tremendous waste of time, energy and money."
117	0	And she’s angry for even suggesting it.
118	0	"But we’re going to — hey look, Nov. 8 you go and vote."
119	0	We’re winning.
120	0	I’ll tell you what.
121	0	"If you vote, we’re winning."
122	0	There’s no way they can beat us.
123	0	"There’s no way she can beat us because her people have no enthusiasm, whatsoever."
124	0	They’re not going to turn out.
125	0	They don’t have the enthusiasm.
126	0	Who could possibly have enthusiasm?
127	0	What are you getting?
128	0	"You turn out, we’re winning big league."
129	0	And I think — and they’re all saying the Trump people are going to turn out.
130	0	"We have a movement like they have never, ever seen in this country."
131	0	And they say in terms of enthusiasm they have never had polling higher.
132	0	"So I think, I have very little doubt, turnout we’re going to have a tremendous Nov. 8."
133	0	"Probably we’ll say Nov. 8 plus the next four years and then four years after that, OK?"
134	0	"But the racist word, it’s the oldest play in the Democratic playbook, and Americans have had enough of it, OK."
135	0	We get it.
136	0	We get it.
137	0	"I’ll tell you what, I just — I told you I just left Little Haiti."
138	0	The love is unbelievable.
139	0	It’s unbelievable.
140	0	There’s no racist.
141	0	There’s no nothing.
142	0	It’s love.
143	0	They want solutions.
144	0	"They want better lives, not more petty attacks from failed and totally discredited politicians like crooked Hillary Clinton."
145	0	They want their immigration laws enforced and their border secured.
146	0	"Let’s win on Nov. 8, OK?"
147	0	That’ll be —
148	0	They’re patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and their families protected.
149	0	They want protection.
150	0	People who warn about radical Islamic terrorism are not Islamophobes.
151	0	Everyone’s an Islamophobe.
152	0	You mention something you’re an Islamophobe.
153	0	You know they come up with words.
154	0	"Hey, I went to Ivy League school."
155	0	I did very well — great.
156	0	They have so many new words.
157	0	Islamophobe.
158	1	We have a president — and frankly Hillary — who don’t use the words radical Islamic terrorism.
159	0	"And if you don’t know what you’re fighting, you’re not going to fight it very well."
160	0	And we’ve proven that.
161	0	We have decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe.
162	0	We want to keep our country safe.
163	0	"People who support the police, who want crime reduced and ended, and who are not prejudiced."
164	1	"They’re concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is killed, violently, on the streets, which is happening all over our country."
165	0	"Yet while Hillary Clinton lives behind gates and walls and guards, and raises millions from hedge funds — you know look what she’s doing with these hedge funds, raising millions and millions."
166	0	I know so many of these people.
167	0	Give me a break.
168	0	The hedge fund and the Wall Street donors she slanders and smears with her statements last week.
169	0	Working people who just want a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians and certainly enjoyed by her.
170	1	Now you know she’s very much against the Second Amendment.
171	1	She wants to destroy your Second Amendment.
172	0	"Guns, guns, guns, right."
173	0	I think what we should do is she goes around with armed bodyguards like you have never seen before.
174	0	I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons.
175	0	"They should disarm, right?"
176	0	Right?
177	0	I think they should disarm immediately.
178	0	What do you think?
179	0	Yes?
180	0	Yeah.
181	0	Take their guns away.
182	1	She doesn’t want guns.
183	0	Take their — let’s see what happens to her.
184	0	Take their guns away.
185	0	OK?
186	0	It’d be very dangerous.
187	0	"Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as secretary of State, hide and delete her e-mails, destroy her iPhones — with a hammer!"
188	0	With a hammer!
189	0	Thirteen of them.
190	0	"Put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through her foundation."
191	0	"It’s the same attitude of arrogance and entitlement that explains why she has never taken accountability for the disaster she created in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Iran and all over the world."
192	0	"Everything she touched, it just didn’t work out."
193	0	Certainly it didn’t work out for our country.
194	1	It’s the same reason why she won’t take responsibility for her central role in unleashing ISIS all over the world.
195	1	Her policies have created disaster overseas and poverty at home.
196	0	We see it.
197	0	"Look, we see it."
198	0	I drove here.
199	0	We see it.
200	0	We see it.
201	0	I’m running to reverse these failures.
202	0	And they are incredible failures.
203	0	And create a new American future.
204	0	And that future begins with prosperity at home.
205	0	My economic agenda can be summed up in three words.
206	0	And you’re going to like these three words.
207	0	"Jobs, jobs, jobs."
208	0	One of my highest priorities is to bring jobs into our inner cities.
209	0	African-American communities have suffered horribly as a result of failed Democratic leadership.
210	0	"Democrats have run these inner cities for a half a century, for 60 years, 75 years, even in some cases 100 years straight."
211	0	Unabated.
212	0	Unbroken.
213	0	Over 100 years.
214	0	"They control the mayor’s offices, the school boards, the city councils and the seats in Congress."
215	0	"And all they have delivered is more poverty, more crime and more failing schools."
216	0	Sixty-five percent of African-American children under the age of six now live in poverty.
217	0	"More than 3,000 people have been shot in the city of Chicago this year."
218	0	This year.
219	0	"Think of it, since Jan. 1."
220	1	Fifty-eight percent of African-American youth are not working.
221	1	Can’t get a job.
222	0	These are the results of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton.
223	0	And everyone knows that if she’s elected the inner cities will get nothing but more pain and suffering and crime and heartache.
224	0	Amazing people.
225	0	Amazing country.
226	0	We have an amazing country.
227	0	And honestly you see the crime statistics.
228	0	You’re African-American.
229	0	You have the inner city problems that have been going on for ever.
230	0	Forever.
231	0	You have problems like nobody has.
232	0	And you look at crime.
233	0	You look at schools.
234	0	You look at no jobs.
235	0	Look at the worst education.
236	0	Look how dangerous.
237	0	You can’t walk down the street.
238	0	You get shot or your child gets shot.
239	0	"And I’ve been saying it, and I’ll say it openly — and some people like it and some people don’t like it, and I don’t really care."
240	0	What do you have to lose?
241	0	I will fix it.
242	0	I’m going to fix it.
243	0	We’re going to fix our inner cities.
244	0	We’re going to make them safe.
245	0	We’re going to bring jobs back.
246	0	"So to the African-American people within the community, what do you have to lose?"
247	0	"It can’t get — honestly, it can’t get — that’s so nice, thank you."
248	0	It can’t get any worse.
249	0	It can’t get any worse.
250	0	It can’t get any worse.
251	0	Thank you.
252	0	So nice.
253	0	Thank you.
254	0	Thank you very much.
255	0	"It can’t get any worse, the crime, the jobs."
256	0	No jobs.
257	0	No education.
258	0	Worst education.
259	0	"More unsafe — you go to Afghanistan, right."
260	0	We hear Afghanistan.
261	0	I mean we have cities that are far more dangerous than Afghanistan.
262	0	Inner cities.
263	0	African-American people within that community and outside of that community are going to be voting for Donald Trump in record numbers.
264	0	You watch.
265	0	We’re going to fix it.
266	0	Hillary Clinton has been in Washington for 30 years.
267	0	Her disastrous record speaks for itself.
268	0	And I have to tell you.
269	0	"When she ran for the United States Senate in New York, we have upstate New York which is a total disaster, economic disaster."
270	0	"She said she’s going to bring back jobs, jobs, jobs."
271	0	"She — anyway, she gets elected."
272	1	We lost our jobs.
273	1	It got worse.
274	0	She didn’t do anything.
275	0	She didn’t do anything.
276	0	She went home.
277	0	"She went to sleep, OK."
278	0	She didn’t do anything.
279	0	She didn’t do anything.
280	1	It got worse.
281	1	"Far worse now, it’s a total catastrophe."
282	0	Just remember that.
283	0	"When she tells you about jobs, when she tells you she’s going to fix trade deals, she wouldn’t know where to begin."
284	0	She wouldn’t know where to begin.
285	0	"And besides that, to do that kind of thing, to negotiate great trade deals, to re-enhance our — I mean look."
286	0	Our military is so depleted.
287	0	We have the greatest people on earth.
288	0	They’re using equipment that’s old.
289	0	They’re flying planes that are old.
290	0	You see what’s happening.
291	0	It’s a depleted military.
292	0	We have to have a strong military.
293	0	We have to take care of our vets.
294	0	We have to take care of our vets.
295	0	But to do these things you need a lot of energy.
296	1	And she does not have the energy.
297	1	And in my opinion she is totally unfit to be the president of the United States.
298	0	"The only people that she will deliver for, frankly, are her donors and her special interests."
299	0	"I’m going to deliver for you, believe me."
300	0	The American people.
301	0	We’re going to deliver.
302	0	You’re gonna be happy.
303	0	"And those inner cities are going to see progress like they have probably, not probably."
304	0	Like they have never seen.
305	0	You watch.
306	0	Like they have never seen.
307	0	Thank you.
308	1	"If we lower our taxes and we’re getting a massive tax reduction — and by the way, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes substantially."
309	0	"If we remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy."
310	0	We have so much energy.
311	0	"It’s being destroyed, our economic worth."
312	0	And negotiate trade deals that put America first.
313	0	Then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash.
314	0	There is no limit.
315	0	Pay off our debt.
316	0	Pay down our debt.
317	0	Reduce taxes.
318	0	Get rid of regulations.
319	0	My first day in office I’m going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last 10 years.
320	0	"All needless, job-killing regulations will be immediately canceled."
321	0	Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.
322	0	And we’re going to lift the restrictions on American energy — which means at least another half a million jobs each year.
323	0	They are being destroyed.
324	0	And we’re unable to compete with other nations.
325	0	Very simple.
326	0	And that’s just the beginning.
327	0	Also on my first day I’m going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.
328	0	It has turned out to be a disaster.
329	1	This alone will instantly save another two million jobs.
330	0	"And if you look at your premiums, it’s through the roof."
331	1	"And by the way, on Nov. 1, just before the election on Nov. 8, new numbers are coming out which will show 40, 50, 60 percent increases."
332	1	They want to delay it until after the election because it’s election — it’s a disaster.
333	0	It’s a disaster.
334	0	"And your deductibles are so high that unless you lead a really long, slow, vicious death, you’re never going to be able to use it, OK."
335	0	Do you see the deductibles?
336	0	You’re never going to be able to use it.
337	0	I’m also going to completely reform our trade deals.
338	0	We’re going to renegotiate NAFTA.
339	0	"Probably the worst trade deal ever agreed to, signed in the history of the world, not in the United States."
340	0	It’s destroyed our manufacturing in our country.
341	0	It’s destroyed.
342	0	"And by the way, guess who signed it?"
343	1	Bill Clinton.
344	0	"You look at all of the places, Florida included."
345	0	"But you look at upstate New York, you look at Ohio, you look at Pennsylvania."
346	1	You look at all of these different places have been destroyed.
347	1	Absolutely destroyed.
348	0	You look at New England.
349	0	Look what happened to New England.
350	0	"They’ve been destroyed by companies moving out, going into Mexico, firing everybody."
351	0	Unemployment through the roof.
352	0	"We’re going to stand up to China, and keep America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership — another catastrophe."
353	0	TPP will be almost as bad as NAFTA.
354	0	Nothing can be as bad as NAFTA.
355	0	Trans-Pacific Partnership will be almost as bad as NAFTA.
356	0	"It’ll take your jobs, Ohio."
357	0	"Remember, it’s going to take your jobs, Ohio."
358	0	I tell you that.
359	0	Michigan.
360	0	So many places.
361	0	TPP is a disaster.
362	0	"We don’t need another massive multinational deal, by the way, that nobody on our side even reads, that ties us up and binds us down and doesn’t even discuss monetary manipulation and devaluation, which is how China and all these countries are beating us so badly."
363	0	Not even discussed.
364	0	"And they had provisions in the agreement, and they would take it out because certain politicians didn’t want to have them in there."
365	0	I wonder why.
366	0	Another major reform is going to be school choice.
367	0	And we’re going to terminate Common Core.
368	1	And we’re bringing our education local.
369	0	"I’ve outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private, public, magnet or religious school of his or her choice."
370	0	"This will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty, something we are going to do."
371	1	Since President Obama came into office another two million Hispanic Americans have fallen into poverty.
372	0	It’s catastrophic.
373	0	And it’s totally unacceptable.
374	0	To the Hispanic community I say we are going to protect your jobs.
375	0	We’re going to build up your schools.
376	0	And we’re going to deliver safety and opportunity for your children.
377	0	You have no safety.
378	0	You have little opportunity.
379	0	This week I also rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable quality child care for their children.
380	0	Child care.
381	0	"Ivanka Trump, very much for child care."
382	0	"She’s been talking about that to me for two years, long before I even decided to go through this journey."
383	0	"And it’s not easy, I want to tell you."
384	0	We speak in rooms like this.
385	0	This is about 100 degrees right now.
386	0	That’s considered a cool auditorium.
387	0	And the reason is we have such big crowds like this one.
388	0	Look at that.
389	0	Every single corner.
390	0	Unbelievable.
391	0	These rooms weren’t designed for this many people.
392	0	And it is hot in these rooms.
393	0	And we stand up here and we talk.
394	0	And we do two or three and sometimes we’ll be hitting four a day.
395	0	Do you think Hillary Clinton can get through one?
396	1	You ever see her 18-minute speech?
397	0	Bomb.
398	0	Bomb.
399	0	Bomb.
400	0	See ya.
401	0	"See ya, I’m going home."
402	0	No.
403	0	We’re doing it the right way.
404	1	"And frankly, when they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising I don’t have to because I do it the old fashioned way."
405	0	"I come into your neighborhood, right."
406	0	It’s a lot cheaper.
407	0	"It’s a lot harder work, but it’s a lot cheaper."
408	0	Very true.
409	0	"Very, very true."
410	0	"On policy after policy we’re going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans."
411	0	We’re also going to stand with the Cuban people in their fight against Communist oppression.
412	0	"No, we’re on the right side."
413	0	Great people.
414	0	They’re great people.
415	0	The president’s one-sided deal for Cuba and with Cuba benefits only the Castro regime.
416	0	People are very unhappy about it.
417	0	You know what’s interesting?
418	0	"When he landed the plane recently in China, right, they refused to give him a stairway out of Air Force One."
419	1	Now that is a first in the history of Air Force One.
420	0	So he used basically the mechanics’ stairs.
421	0	"That’s the stairs they drop down to get the mechanics up to fix the light bulb, right."
422	0	"When he landed the plane in Saudi Arabia, which we protect."
423	0	Without us they wouldn’t be there for two months.
424	0	He landed in Saudi Arabia.
425	0	He wasn’t greeted by the top officials.
426	0	Now what would I have done in those two cases?
427	0	Bomb.
428	0	"Take me back to Washington, Jim."
429	0	Let’s go.
430	0	Right.
431	0	Let’s go.
432	0	"Let’s go, Jim."
433	0	Get going.
434	0	Close those doors.
435	0	We’re going home.
436	0	"Now with Cuba, with Cuba we land in Cuba and there’s no Castro to greet him."
437	0	The big leaders weren’t there to greet him.
438	0	And I have a lot of Cuban friends.
439	0	But you would have all done the same thing again.
440	0	"Jim, let’s close those doors."
441	0	We’re going home.
442	0	Right?
443	0	Right?
444	0	"Let’s go, captain."
445	0	We’re going home.
446	0	We’re going into Washington.
447	0	Maybe we’ll head into Miami actually.
448	0	That’s not a bad idea.
449	0	Terrible.
450	0	That’s three.
451	0	Three.
452	0	"Saudi Arabia, Cuba, China."
453	1	Air Force One has never been treated so badly in its long and incredible history.
454	0	Air Force One used to land and people would respect the people inside.
455	0	And they’d come out and there’d be all sorts of hoopla.
456	0	Not anymore.
457	0	It’s unbelievable.
458	0	And these are countries that have benefited by us greatly.
459	0	"So we have to make great deals before we do anything with Cuba or anybody else, right."
460	0	We’re going to make great deals.
461	0	You’ll be happy.
462	0	"You’re going to be happy, I tell you."
463	0	How many people are from Cuba here?
464	0	Come here.
465	0	Tell me.
466	0	Cuban.
467	0	Cuban.
468	0	Good.
469	0	Do you agree with me?
470	0	Do you agree?
471	0	We’ll do it.
472	0	But we’ll do it with great deals.
473	0	And we’ll do it with democracy.
474	0	And we’ll do it the way we have to do it.
475	0	OK?
476	0	We’ll do it the right way.
477	0	Where is Ms.
478	0	Delgado?
479	0	Does everybody know?
480	0	What a great — where is she?
481	0	She is so amazing.
482	0	A.J.
483	0	Where is A.J.
484	0	"Wow, she’s so — she’s become a tremendous star."
485	0	"Tell you one thing, when she’s representing me I wouldn’t do it anyway, but I can."
486	0	Turn off the television.
487	0	I’m well protected.
488	0	Thank you.
489	0	Great job.
490	0	Thank you very much.
491	0	"Thank you, A.J."
492	0	"But all of the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the Castro regime were done through executive order, which means the next president can reverse them."
493	0	And that I will do unless the Castro regime meets our demands.
494	0	"Not my demands, our demands."
495	0	You know what the demands are.
496	0	Those demands will include religious and political freedom for the Cuban people.
497	0	And the freeing of political prisoners.
498	0	The freeing of political prisoners.
499	0	Right?
500	0	Am I — is that right?
501	0	Oh boy.
502	0	Oh boy.
503	0	What energy in this room.
504	0	What energy.
505	0	A lot of energy.
506	0	"You’ll be very happy, my Cuban friends."
507	0	I have so many friends from Cuba.
508	0	Incredible people.
509	0	So let’s also talk about a place called Venezuela.
510	0	They — now who’s here from Venezuela?
511	0	Or related in some — not too many.
512	0	Whoa.
513	0	Whoa.
514	0	What’s going on?
515	0	Not too many?
516	0	Friend or foe?
517	0	I think he’s friend.
518	0	I think he’s friend.
519	0	"No, he’s OK."
520	0	He’s OK.
521	0	"By the way, is there any place more fun to be than a Trump rally?"
522	0	You tell me.
523	0	Right?
524	0	Tell you.
525	0	"We have a lot of Venezuelans around Doral, the Doral section, right."
526	0	"And it’s a beautiful, vibrant — this is an amazing place."
527	0	But they are really having trouble over in Venezuela.
528	0	"But Miami is filled with hardworking, incredible Venezuelan people."
529	0	But it’s been hurt very badly by Socialist Venezuela.
530	0	And the next president of the United States must stand in solidarity with all people oppressed in our atmosphere.
531	0	And we will stand with oppressed people.
532	0	And there are many.
533	0	"The oppressed people of Venezuela, they are yearning to be free."
534	0	They are yearning for help.
535	0	The system is bad.
536	0	But the people are great.
537	0	Great.
538	0	They are great people.
539	0	Here in America I’ll push to expand freedom for all of our citizens.
540	0	I’m going to lower your taxes so substantially.
541	0	We’re getting rid of all of those regulations on business.
542	0	"So many small business owners here, I know five of them."
543	0	One of them was small business now he’s big business.
544	0	I’m proud of him.
545	0	He’s right here.
546	0	"But we’re going to get rid of those terrible, terrible regulations."
547	0	"He just said to me, and the thing that surprised me most, we’re bringing business tax rates down from 35 percent to 15 percent."
548	0	"And yet — it’ll be the greatest cut, I believe, in the history of our country."
549	0	"But I will tell you what surprises me tremendously is that the people that have these cuts, they’re more concerned with regulation than even a big tax decrease because regulations are choking and killing our businesses and stopping our businesses from hiring people, jobs."
550	0	So I’m going to appoint justices of the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution.
551	0	"I’m going to rebuild our depleted — we’re going to take care of our, the vets."
552	0	Who’s a vet?
553	0	Who’s a vet?
554	0	Where are my vets?
555	0	Where are they?
556	0	There they — OK.
557	0	Now they’re standing up.
558	0	Now they — I know we had a lot of vets here.
559	0	"Thank you, fellas."
560	0	Thank you very much.
561	0	We’re going to take care of our vets.
562	0	We’re going to save your Second Amendment.
563	0	"Do you know if you look at some of the things, the catastrophes — you look at Orlando."
564	0	You look at San Bernardino.
565	0	You look at so many different — you look at Paris.
566	0	"The toughest gun laws in the world, they have it in Paris."
567	0	"These thugs, these animals walked in and they just go bomb, bomb, bomb."
568	1	Nobody had guns on the other side.
569	1	"If there were guns on the other side, just a few of them, number one, probably if they knew, they wouldn’t have attacked."
570	0	"And number two, even if they did attack, it would’ve been a whole different story."
571	0	One hundred thirty people killed.
572	0	"People massively injured, still in the hospital."
573	0	Their lives are just destroyed.
574	1	"And if they had protection, if they had guns on the other side, with the bullets flying the other direction, it would’ve been a whole different story."
575	0	So we’re going to protect your Second Amendment.
576	0	And I’m going to stop illegal immigration and drugs from coming into our country.
577	0	"And yes, we will build a wall."
578	0	We’ll build a wall.
579	0	We will build a wall.
580	0	Who’s going to pay for the wall?
581	0	One hundred percent.
582	0	One hundred percent.
583	0	And we’re going to be renegotiating NAFTA and our terrible trade deals.
584	0	We’re going to make great deals out of horrible deals.
585	0	"And if we can’t renegotiate the deal because the other side is so, so happy with it, we’re going to terminate the deal and we’ll start all over again, folks."
586	0	We’ll have new deals.
587	0	And they’ll be much better deals.
588	0	And they’ll be two-way streets.
589	0	"The traffic, it’ll be coming our way."
590	0	It’s a one-way street out of the United States for our jobs and our money.
591	0	"You know I always say we get the drugs, they get the cash."
592	0	"That’s the deal, folks."
593	0	No good.
594	0	"They’re building in Mexico right now, and Mexico’s just one example, some of the greatest plants."
595	0	A friend of mine builds plants.
596	0	And he tells me all the time — I called him up the other day.
597	0	"I called him up six months ago, told me the same thing."
598	0	Nothing changes.
599	0	Ford.
600	1	"They just announced yesterday they’re moving their small car division, the whole thing, into Mexico."
601	0	That’s on top of spending billions and billions of dollars.
602	0	And then you wonder why I’m winning in Michigan.
603	0	Because I’ve been telling the people in Michigan.
604	0	I’ve been telling the people in Ohio for five years that this is happening.
605	0	And our politicians don’t do anything about it.
606	0	And Hillary Clinton will never do anything about it.
607	0	She doesn’t have the capability to do it.
608	0	"We will rebuild our roads and bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals."
609	0	American cars will travel the roads.
610	0	American planes will soar in the sky.
611	0	They’ll soar.
612	0	And American ships will patrol the seas.
613	0	American steel will send new skyscrapers right here in Miami into the clouds.
614	0	But it’ll be American steel.
615	0	American hands will rebuild this nation.
616	0	And American energy mined from American sources will power our energy.
617	0	And we’ll take care of our steel workers.
618	0	"And we’ll take care of our miners who have been destroyed by this administration, destroyed."
619	1	And Hillary Clinton has already said she’s going to put the miners out of business.
620	0	We’re going to take care of our miners.
621	0	They’re amazing people.
622	0	American workers will be hired to do the job.
623	0	We will put new American steel into the spine of our country.
624	0	I will fight for every neglected part of this nation.
625	0	And I will fight to bring us all together as one people.
626	0	"Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one flag."
627	0	"It’s time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future."
628	0	We’re not prosperous anymore.
629	0	We owe $20 trillion.
630	0	We have a president who in seven-and-a-half years has doubled the debt.
631	0	Our country’s in trouble.
632	0	"A lot of people don’t know it, but our country’s in trouble."
633	0	And we’re going to make sure that trouble never comes.
634	0	Let me tell you.
635	0	Jobs will return.
636	0	Incomes will rise.
637	0	And new factories will come rushing back to our shores.
638	0	"Once more we will have a government of, by and for the people."
639	0	We will make America wealthy again.
640	0	We will make America safe again.
641	0	We will make America strong again.
642	0	And we will make America great again.
643	0	"Thank you, everybody."
644	0	Thank you.
645	0	"Thank you, Miami."
1	0	Thank you very much everybody.
2	0	We’ve had a great three days at the United Nations in New York.
3	0	And this is quite a gathering.
4	0	Wow.
5	0	It’s a lot of people.
6	0	A lot of media.
7	0	(LAUGHTER)
8	0	We’ve covered a great deal of territory.
9	0	"Just left, as you know, Prime Minister Abe of Japan."
10	0	We’re starting trade talks with Japan.
11	0	"They were not willing, for years, to talk trade, and now they’re willing to talk trade."
12	0	And I’m sure we’ll make a very good deal.
13	0	"Just concluded, as you know — two days ago, signed a deal with South Korea — a trade deal."
14	0	A tremendous deal with South Korea.
15	0	It means a lot of business for our farmers.
16	0	We’re opening up for farmers.
17	0	We’re opening up for a lot of different groups.
18	0	We’re going to be able to sell much more than double the number of automobiles that we were allowed under a deal that was totally defective that was there before.
19	0	And so we’re very happy with that.
20	0	That deal is actually concluded.
21	0	We’re very well along the way with Mexico.
22	0	The relationship is very good.
23	0	"And with Canada, we’ll see what happens."
24	0	They’re charging us 300-percent tariffs on dairy products.
25	0	We can’t have that.
26	0	We can’t have that.
27	0	"With China, as you know, we put out an announcement today."
28	0	They would like to see me lose an election because they’ve never been challenged like this.
29	0	But I want to open up China to our farmers and to our industrialists and our companies.
30	0	"And China is not open, but we’re open to them."
31	0	"They charge us 25, 35, 55 percent for things, and we charge them nothing in terms of coming into the country."
32	0	"Cars, they’re at 25 percent."
33	0	"And we’re at 2 percent and 2.5 percent, and don’t even collect it."
34	0	But we collect it now.
35	0	So we’re doing very well in our situation with China on trade.
36	0	"I have a great relationship with the President of China, President Xi."
37	0	But it’s got to be a two-way street.
38	0	"It — for 25 years and longer, it was not."
39	0	And trillions and trillions of dollars was taken out of the United States for the benefit of China.
40	0	We just can’t have that.
41	0	We have to make it fair.
42	0	"So we’re at $250 billion now, at 25 percent interest."
43	0	And a lot of money is coming into our coffers.
44	0	"And it’s had no impact on our — absolutely, by the way, no impact on our economy, which I said it wouldn’t."
45	0	"In fact, steel is like the hottest industry there is."
46	0	"If you look at what happened with steel, we’re charging a 25 percent tariff for the dumpers."
47	0	They dump massive amounts of steel.
48	0	They want to put the steel companies out of business.
49	0	"And after they’re out of business, they’ll come in and charge five times more than you ever thought possible."
50	0	And we need steel and we need aluminum.
51	0	And those industries are doing well.
52	0	But steel is incredible.
53	1	U.S. Steel is opening up a minimum of eight plants.
54	0	Nucor is opening up plants.
55	0	"And these are big plants — $750 million and a billion dollar plants, in some cases."
56	0	So what’s happening with the steel industry is very exciting to me.
57	0	It’s being rebuilt overnight.
58	0	"If you look at the miners in coal, if you look at energy, LNG — Japan just gave us some numbers that are incredible."
59	0	They’re doubling the amount that they are going to be buying for Japan.
60	0	They’re taking the LNG and they’re doubling it up.
61	0	"I said, ""You have to do me a favor. We don’t want these big deficits. You’re going to have to buy more"""
62	0	"They’re buying massive amounts of equipment and military equipment, and other countries are doing the same thing."
63	0	Because we have trade imbalances with almost everybody.
64	0	It’s a rare exception that we don’t.
65	0	So we are doing great as a country.
66	0	"Unfortunately, they just raised interest rates a little bit because we are doing so well."
67	0	"I’m not happy about that, because I know it’s going to be a question."
68	0	I am not happy about that.
69	0	"I’d rather pay down debt or do other things, create more jobs."
70	0	So I’m worried about the fact that they seem to like raising interest rates.
71	0	We can do other things with the money.
72	0	And — but they raised them.
73	0	And they’re raising them because we’re doing so well.
74	0	"You know, we’re doing much better than I had projected in terms of — when I was campaigning, I said we were going to do this and we’re doing much better than anybody ever thought possible."
75	0	"And, I will say, if others got in, it would have been just the opposite because they were going to put restrictions on."
76	0	They were going to put regulations on.
77	0	"They were going to choke the economy as it was already choking, but it would have been worse."
78	0	And they were going to raise your taxes.
79	0	"That’s what they want to do now if they ever got control, which I don’t think they’ll have control for a long time."
80	0	"So, with that being said, we’ll take some questions and — yes, please."
81	0	"John, go ahead."
82	0	We have plenty of time.
83	0	"Mr. President, thank you very much."
84	0	"Of course, what you’re looking forward to tomorrow is the hearings with Judge Kavanaugh —"
85	0	Yes.
86	0	— before the Judiciary Committee.
87	0	"In 1991, when Joe Biden passed along to the Bush 41 White House the allegations that Anita Hill had raised against Clarence Thomas, the Bush White House asked the FBI to look into it as part of Judge Thomas’s background investigation — not a criminal investigation, but the background investigation."
88	0	Right.
89	0	Right.
90	0	"When these allegations were raised, why didn’t this White House do the same thing?"
91	0	"And with all of the allegations that are coming out now about Judge Kavanaugh, was there an opportunity missed here to have investigators look into this and get some sort of clarity one way or the other?"
92	0	"Well, the FBI told us they’ve investigated Judge Kavanaugh six times, five times, many times over the years."
93	0	They know him very well.
94	1	"But here, there was nothing to investigate from at least one standpoint."
95	1	They didn’t know the location.
96	1	They didn’t know the time.
97	1	They didn’t know the year.
98	1	They didn’t know anything.
99	0	"And it’s like, where do you go?"
100	0	"Also, it’s not for the FBI."
101	1	"If you look at what Joe Biden said, he said, ""They don’t do this"""
102	0	And he said it very clearly.
103	0	"So I think when you really look at it all, it’s not going to change any of the Democrats’ minds."
104	0	They’re obstructionists.
105	0	They’re actually con artists because they know how quality this man is and they’ve destroyed a man’s reputation and they want to destroy it even more.
106	0	And I think people are going to see that in the midterms.
107	0	"What they’ve done to this family, what they’ve done to these children — these beautiful children of his — and what they’ve done to his wife."
108	0	"And they know it’s a big, fat con job."
109	0	"And they go into a room and, I guarantee you, they laugh like hell at what they’ve pulled off on you and on the public."
110	0	They laugh like hell.
111	0	"So, it wouldn’t have mattered if the FBI came back with the cleanest score."
112	0	"And you understand that very well, John."
113	0	"If they would have come back with the most perfect — ""We found everything, and he’s perfectly innocent of everything"""
114	0	It wouldn’t have made a difference.
115	0	You wouldn’t have gotten one vote.
116	0	Now we will get votes from the Democrats if we win.
117	0	"You’ll have three, four, or five Democrats giving us votes, because they’re in states that I won by 30 and 40 points and they’re going to give us votes."
118	0	"But other than that, you probably won’t get any, John."
119	0	"Yes, go ahead."
120	0	Please.
121	0	"Mr. President, there are now three women accusing Judge Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct."
122	0	Are you saying that all three of those women are liars?
123	0	Is there anything that can be said at this point tomorrow —
124	0	Yeah.
125	0	— that could cause you to withdraw the nomination?
126	0	Anything at all that —
127	0	I won’t get into that game.
128	0	"I’ll only tell you this: This is one of the highest quality people that I’ve ever met, and everybody that knows him says the same thing."
129	0	"And these are all false — to me, these are false accusations in certain cases."
130	0	"And certain cases, even the media agrees with that."
131	0	"I can only say that, what they’ve done to this man is incredible."
132	0	"You know, it’s very interesting — I pick a lot of judges."
133	0	I have 145 judges I will be picking by the end of a fairly short period of time because President Obama wasn’t big on picking judges.
134	0	"When I got there, I said, ""How is this possible?"""
135	0	I have 145 — including court of appeals — judges.
136	0	And they just didn’t do it.
137	0	You know why?
138	0	They got tired.
139	0	They got complacent.
140	0	Something happened.
141	0	I have 145 judges.
142	0	Everybody wants to be a federal judge.
143	0	"Not just a Supreme Court judge, I’m talking about court of appeals; I’m talking about district court."
144	0	I don’t think they’re going to want to so much.
145	0	"I’ll be calling people, and we’ll have people calling people that do this."
146	0	"And people are going to be scared because we could say it about you, ""Thirty-five years ago, you met some…"" — and you might know — you might not know what’s going on."
147	0	What is going on?
148	0	Why did they wait so long?
149	0	Why did Senator Feinstein wait until the hearings were over and make this case?
150	0	Why didn’t she bring it right at the beginning?
151	0	"When you ask about, as an example, the FBI — why didn’t they bring this right at the beginning, during the hearing?"
152	0	You would have had all the time in the world for the FBI.
153	0	It would have been fine.
154	0	"Now the FBI, as you know, did investigate this time, as they have five or six other times."
155	0	And they did a very thorough investigation.
156	0	But this is a big con job.
157	0	"And I would love to be in the room with the Democrats, close the door — you guys are all away, outside, waiting."
158	0	And Schumer and his buddies are all in there laughing how they fooled you all.
159	0	Let’s just stop them.
160	0	A big fat con.
161	0	"Yeah, go ahead."
162	0	"But, Mr. President, if I could follow up."
163	0	You have daughters.
164	0	Can you understand why a victim of sexual assault would not report it at the time?
165	0	Don’t you understand —
166	0	"By the way, I only say this: thirty-six years — no charge, no nothing."
167	0	Everybody —
168	0	But — but that happens often.
169	0	I mean —
170	0	People are going to have to make a decision.
171	0	"Thirty-six years, there’s no charge."
172	0	"All of a sudden, the hearings are over and the rumors start coming out."
173	0	"And then you have this other con artist, Avenatti, come out with another beauty today."
174	0	I only say that you have to look at the facts.
175	0	The senators are very capable people.
176	0	They’re very good people.
177	0	I know many of them.
178	0	They’re friends of mine.
179	0	"These are very talented, very good people."
180	0	And they’re going to vote.
181	0	They’re going to believe what they believe.
182	0	"I can — when I look at what’s happened to the reputation of a great gentleman — a great intellect; a brilliant man; somebody that has a chance to be one of our great Supreme Court Justices in history, intellectually — I think it’s a shame."
183	0	"Yes, please."
184	0	"Yes, Mr. President."
185	0	My name is Tomás Regalado from Radio and TV Marti.
186	0	"Mr. President, yesterday at the speech at the U.N., you spoke about how Venezuela’s problem was because of Cuba and the Castros — how they went in there and they brought socialism and communism to Venezuela, and now to Nicaragua as well."
187	0	"Mr. President, are you going to be more proactive now against Cuba as well?"
188	0	I’ve been very proactive against Cuba.
189	0	I don’t like what’s happening in Cuba.
190	0	"As you know, President Obama gave them a pass and I didn’t like it."
191	0	Neither do Cuban people based in Miami and based in our country that came from Cuba and suffered in Cuba.
192	0	I don’t like what he did.
193	0	I’ve ended much of it — most of it.
194	0	"I don’t like what’s happening in Cuba, and I certainly don’t like what’s happening in Venezuela."
195	0	"Yes, please."
196	0	Mr. President.
197	0	Go ahead.
198	0	"Mr. President, just to finish really fast."
199	0	You said also that you had a call-to-action to ask the leaders around the world to also end socialism.
200	0	Would you like to be recognized as —
201	0	"Well, I wouldn’t say that socialism has been working really well around the world, okay."
202	0	"You can take a look at Venezuela as your number one — your number one — I guess, the one that is most obvious."
203	0	"But you take a look around the world, socialism is not exactly riding high."
204	0	Please.
205	0	"Thank you, Mr. President."
206	0	Go ahead.
207	0	Thank you very much.
208	0	"If you don’t mind, after I’m finished, if Weijia, or Hallie, or Vivian, or one of our female colleagues could go after me, that would be great."
209	0	"Mr. President, just to follow up on these allegations against Brett Kavanaugh —"
210	0	What does he mean by that?
211	0	Explain.
212	0	What does that mean?
213	0	I think it would be great if a female reporter —
214	0	What does it mean?
215	0	"No, what does it mean?"
216	0	I think it would great if a female reporter would ask you a question about this issue.
217	0	"So if you don’t mind, I would ask —"
218	0	I wouldn’t mind that at all.
219	0	No.
220	0	Wouldn’t mind it at all.
221	0	All right.
222	0	"Well, let me — if I could call on —"
223	0	Wouldn’t make any difference to me.
224	0	All right.
225	0	Go ahead.
226	0	"If I could follow up on John, and John’s question."
227	0	"Why is it, Mr. President, that you always seem to side with the accused and not the accuser?"
228	0	"You have three women here who are all making allegations, who are all asking that their stories be heard."
229	0	"And, you know, if you look at the case of Roy Moore, if you look at the case of one of your staffers, you seem to, time and again, side with the accused and not the accuser."
230	0	Is that because of the many allegations that you’ve had made against you over the years?
231	0	"Well, first of all, I wasn’t happy with Roy Moore."
232	0	Let’s get that straight.
233	0	But Roy Moore was a Republican candidate —
234	0	But you stood by him.
235	0	— and I would have rather had a Republican candidate win.
236	0	"I was very happy with Luther Strange, who was a terrific man from Alabama, but Luther Strange had a lot of things going against him."
237	0	"As far as women, whether it’s a man or a woman, these are — you know, it can happen the other way."
238	0	Allegations can go the other way also.
239	0	You understand that.
240	0	"And whether it was a man or a woman, 30 years ago, 36 years ago — in fact, they don’t even know how many years ago because nobody knows what the time is."
241	0	That’s a long time.
242	0	"And I could pick, as an example — hopefully I won’t have to do it as a replacement because hopefully this is going to go very well on Thursday."
243	0	"It’s going to go very well on Monday, or Saturday, or Sunday, or whenever they vote."
244	0	But I could pick a woman and she could have charges made from many years ago also.
245	0	"But don’t you understand, sir, that many of these —"
246	0	And I would look at the character —
247	0	— many of these accusers —
248	0	"No, what I have to do —"
249	0	— are reluctant to come forward.
250	0	You’ve raised doubts about these accusers.
251	0	Many of them are reluctant to come forward.
252	0	I don’t think people are reluctant to come forward.
253	0	They’re going to have a chance to speak at a major — they have a major chance to speak.
254	0	But you’re saying why (inaudible) —
255	0	Excuse me.
256	0	Excuse me.
257	0	They have a major chance to speak.
258	0	"And it will be tomorrow, I assume."
259	0	"We’ve delayed this — meaning the Republican senators, not me."
260	0	The Republicans senators have delayed this for weeks now.
261	0	They’re giving the women a major chance to speak.
262	0	"Now it’s possible I’ll hear that, and I’ll say, ""Hey, I’m changing my mind"""
263	0	That is possible.
264	0	We want to give them a chance to speak.
265	0	And they’re given —
266	0	Do you think all three should have a chance — all three should have a chance to speak?
267	0	"Well, whoever is given a chance."
268	0	We’ve delayed it a long time.
269	0	But they’re going to have a big shot at speaking and making their case.
270	0	And you know what?
271	0	I could be persuaded also.
272	0	Okay?
273	0	Yes.
274	0	Please.
275	0	"Please, go ahead."
276	0	Go ahead.
277	0	"I would like to go — yes, go ahead."
278	0	Please.
279	0	"Thank you, Mr. President."
280	0	Thank you.
281	0	"Thank you, Mr. President."
282	0	"And a couple of questions for you to follow up on some answers that I didn’t quite hear from you, if you would allow me a couple of questions."
283	0	"First of all, do you think these women — all three of them are liars?"
284	0	Yes or no?
285	0	Have they been what?
286	0	Are they liars?
287	0	I can’t tell you.
288	0	I have to watch tomorrow.
289	0	I have to read.
290	0	I just heard about one a little while ago.
291	0	"I can tell you her lawyer is a low life, okay?"
292	0	So I can’t tell you whether or not they’re liars until I hear them.
293	0	"I don’t know what happened today because I’ve been very busy with Japan, with South Korea, with China, and about seven other countries, as you know — and I chaired the Security Council."
294	0	So I don’t know about today’s person that came forward.
295	0	I do know about the lawyer.
296	0	"And you don’t get much worse — bad reputation, too."
297	0	Take a look at his past.
298	0	"So, as far as the other women are concerned, I’m going to see what happens tomorrow."
299	0	"I’m going to be watching — you know, believe it or not."
300	0	I’m going to see what’s said.
301	0	It’s possible that they will be convincing.
302	0	"Now, with all of that being said, Judge Brett Kavanaugh has been, for many years, one of the most respected people in Washington."
303	0	He’s been on — I guess you’d call it the second highest court.
304	0	And every single person knows him; a lot of people know him well. And those people don’t believe what’s going on.
305	0	I can always be convinced.
306	0	I have to hear it.
307	0	"It sounds like what you’re saying is, there is a situation, there is a scenario under which you would withdraw Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination."
308	0	Is that correct?
309	0	And have you talked about that with him?
310	0	"If I thought he was — if I thought he was guilty of something like this, yeah sure."
311	0	And you will wait until tomorrow to make up your mind about it?
312	0	I want to watch.
313	0	I want to see.
314	0	I hope I can watch.
315	0	"I’m meeting with a lot of countries tomorrow, but I will certainly, in some form, be able to watch."
316	0	"And I’ll also rely on some very fair and talented Republican senators who — look, if we brought George Washington here and we said, ""We have George Washington,"" the Democrats would vote against him, just so you understand."
317	0	"And he may have had a bad past, who knows, you know."
318	0	(LAUGHTER)
319	0	"He may have had some, I think, accusations made."
320	0	Didn’t he have a couple of things in his past?
321	0	George Washington would be voted against 100 percent by Schumer and the con artists.
322	0	I mean 100 percent.
323	0	One hundred percent.
324	0	So it really doesn’t matter from their standpoint.
325	0	"That’s why when John asked about the FBI — if the FBI did the most thorough investigation in the history of the FBI, and they found him to be 100-percent perfect, he would lose every single vote."
326	0	"Now, if the Republicans win tomorrow, I think you’re going to get some votes from the Democrats."
327	0	You know why?
328	0	Because — we all know why — because it’s called politics.
329	0	Then you’ll probably get some votes.
330	0	"Okay, let’s go."
331	0	"And my final question, sir,"
332	0	One more question.
333	0	Yes.
334	0	Just to follow up —
335	0	"She stands up: ""I’d like to ask about three questions"""
336	0	It’s not really fair to everyone else.
337	0	This will be my last one —
338	0	Should I let her ask another question?
339	0	(CROSSTALK)
340	0	— to follow up on —
341	0	Go ahead.
342	0	See?
343	0	"— to follow up on a question that a colleague asked as well about the benefit of the doubt that you have given to people like Roy Moore, to Roger Ailes, to Bill O’Reilly, to Brett Kavanaugh."
344	0	They’re all men.
345	0	Why is that?
346	0	It’s not a benefit of the doubt.
347	0	I’ve —
348	0	Has there ever been an instance when you’ve given the benefit of the doubt to a woman?
349	0	I’ve known them.
350	0	"Hallie, I’ve know them for a long time and — a lot of these people."
351	0	A lot of people.
352	0	And some I’ve been disappointed with.
353	0	I have been disappointed with some.
354	0	"Others, like — you know, there are charges that are pretty weak."
355	0	But I’ve known people for a long time.
356	0	I never saw them do anything wrong.
357	0	I never saw them do anything wrong.
358	0	And there are some that probably — I agree.
359	0	I can tell you there are some that I — I’ve been watching for a long time.
360	0	"And in a couple of cases, they weren’t Republicans."
361	0	"In a lot of cases, they were not; they were exactly the opposite."
362	0	But I’ve been watching them for a long time.
363	0	And I knew for a long time these were not good people.
364	0	And they were never brought up.
365	0	Okay.
366	0	"Yes, ma’am."
367	0	Go ahead.
368	0	Thank you very much by the way.
369	0	Thank you.
370	0	"Thank you very much, Mr. President."
371	0	Thank you.
372	0	"When the allegations first surfaced, you initially said how important it was for Dr. Ford to testify and that you wanted to hear from her."
373	0	I do.
374	0	But —
375	0	I wish it could have gone quicker.
376	0	"Well, you also said that if what she said were as bad as she claims, surely her or her parents would have reported it."
377	0	"And just today, you said, you wouldn’t —"
378	0	"Well, there is a truth."
379	0	I mean there is a chance that her parents could have reported it 36 years ago.
380	0	So my question is —
381	0	"It doesn’t mean they had to report it because, in some instances, people keep it quiet."
382	0	"It’s a very tough situation for a woman, there’s no question about it."
383	0	"And in some cases, they do report it."
384	0	"Frankly, had they reported it, it would’ve been pretty amazing, wouldn’t it?"
385	0	"But I guess they didn’t, and that’s okay."
386	0	I’m not saying they had to report it because it’s a very personal thing.
387	0	"It’s a very big problem, there’s no question about it."
388	0	Go ahead.
389	0	But do you want to hear her story before you draw a conclusion —
390	0	"I’d like to hear her story, yeah."
391	0	"Well, we’re giving her a time."
392	0	— or have you already made up your mind?
393	0	They would’ve given her time last week.
394	0	This is the United States Senate.
395	0	"This is the most important position that a President can give out, I think we can say, by far."
396	0	I’ve actually heard it’s the most important decision a President can make.
397	0	I disagree with that.
398	0	"War and peace — I always say, ""War and peace"""
399	0	"And after that, Supreme Court Justice."
400	0	Right?
401	0	I look forward to hearing from her.
402	0	We could’ve heard from her last week; we could have heard from her for a long time.
403	0	It’ll be interesting to hear what she has to say.
404	0	Okay?
405	0	And let me follow up on Jim’s question.
406	0	"Mr. President, let me follow up on Jim’s question that I don’t think we got an answer to."
407	0	Which one?
408	0	Which question?
409	0	Who?
410	0	How have your personal experiences being accused by more than a dozen women of sexual misconduct —
411	0	I’ve been accused.
412	0	I’ve been accused.
413	0	False accusations.
414	0	"— right, how have those —"
415	0	Excuse me.
416	0	I’ve been accused.
417	0	"And I was accused by — I believe, it was — four women."
418	0	You can check with Sean Hannity.
419	1	"You can check with Fox, because they covered it very strongly — who got paid."
420	0	And how has (inaudible) —
421	0	Excuse me.
422	0	Excuse me.
423	1	I was accused by four or five women who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me.
424	0	"We caught them, and the mainstream media refused to put it on television."
425	0	They refused to even write about it.
426	0	"There were four women, and maybe more — I think the number is four or five."
427	1	"But one had a mortgage paid off her house, $52,000."
428	0	Another one had other things happen.
429	0	"And the one that reported it, I believe, was offered $750,000 to say bad things about me — and she is the one that reported it."
430	0	This woman is incredible.
431	0	"She reported it, instead of taking the money."
432	0	So I’ve had numerous accusations about me.
433	0	Right.
434	0	"I mean, they made false statements about me, knowing they were false."
435	0	I never met them.
436	0	I never met these people.
437	0	"And, what did they do?"
438	0	What did they do?
439	1	They took money in order to say bad things.
440	0	I’ve had stories written in the New York Times — front page — about four women.
441	0	The whole top center front page of the New York Times.
442	0	I think it was four big pictures.
443	0	"I said, ""Wow. That’s a big thing. What’s that?"""
444	0	These were women that were quoted saying bad things about me.
445	0	"Not the worst things about me, but bad things."
446	0	"And I said, ""Gee, that’s too bad"""
447	0	"I knew them a long time ago — 15 years ago, 20 years ago."
448	0	"I said, ""That’s too bad. I’m surprised at them."""
449	0	And then all of a sudden I see them on television — nothing to do with me.
450	0	"The next day or a day later, they were incensed."
451	0	"They said, ""Donald Trump is a nice guy. We never said this. The New York Times did false reporting. They’re fake news"""
452	0	And you know what?
453	0	The New York Times would not report that their story was fake.
454	0	"These women said great things. Not only did they not say the bad stuff, they said great things about me."
455	0	Front page.
456	0	"And those women — they’re incredible women — they went on television — and they didn’t want to, and I didn’t ask them."
457	0	"And they said, ""The New York Times made it up. They gave false quotes"""
458	0	And they went on a lot of shows.
459	0	They were really incensed and they couldn’t believe it.
460	0	That’s why people know that a lot of the news is fake.
461	0	And a lot of the people sitting here are fake.
462	0	But 20 percent of them are wonderful.
463	0	Okay?
464	0	"If I could just actually ask my question, Mr. Trump."
465	0	I — you didn’t let me ask my question.
466	0	"You’ve been asking a question for 10 minutes, all right?"
467	0	"No, you interrupted my question."
468	0	Please sit down. Please.
469	0	I’m asking you —
470	0	Go ahead.
471	0	Go ahead.
472	0	— how did those impact your opinions on the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh?
473	0	"Well, it does impact my opinion."
474	0	You know why?
475	0	Because I’ve had a lot of false charges made against me.
476	0	"I’m a very famous person, unfortunately."
477	0	I’ve been a famous person for a long time.
478	0	But I’ve had a lot of false charges made against me — really false charges.
479	0	I know friends that have had false charges.
480	0	People want fame.
481	0	They want money.
482	0	They want whatever.
483	0	"So when I see it, I view it differently than somebody sitting home watching television, where they say, ""Oh, Judge Kavanaugh…"" this or that."
484	0	It’s happened to me many times.
485	0	I’ve had many false charges; I had a woman sitting in an airplane and I attacked her while people were coming onto the plane.
486	0	And I have a number-one bestseller out?
487	0	I mean it was total phony story.
488	0	There are many of them.
489	0	"So when you say, does it affect me in terms of my thinking with respect to Judge Kavanaugh?"
490	0	Absolutely.
491	0	Because I’ve had it many times.
492	0	And if the news would have reported these four people — I couldn’t believe it.
493	0	"When I heard that they caught these four people, I said, ""Wow. That’s a big story"""
494	0	And it was — for Fox.
495	0	Okay.
496	0	"Thank you, Mr. President."
497	0	"Earlier today and just now, you made a significant allegation against the Chinese government."
498	0	You suggested that the Chinese —
499	0	I did.
500	0	— had meddled in or are meddling in —
501	0	That’s right.
502	0	That’s what I hear.
503	0	— the 2018 midterm elections.
504	0	That’s what I hear.
505	0	"What evidence do you have of that, sir?"
506	0	"Is there a national intelligence estimate, for example, that you’re prepared to put forward?"
507	0	We have evidence.
508	0	We have evidence.
509	0	It’ll come out.
510	0	"Yeah, I can’t tell you now, but it came — it didn’t come out of nowhere, that I can tell you."
511	0	"Now, if you — they’ve actually admitted that they’re going after farmers."
512	0	"I mean, I think most of you can cover that."
513	0	"I like that you’re shaking your head, ""yes"""
514	0	I’m going to ask you the next question because of that. Okay?
515	0	It’s probably going to be the killer of all questions.
516	0	(LAUGHTER)
517	0	But let me just explain —
518	0	But why make the charges now —
519	0	"No, no, no."
520	0	Let me —
521	0	"— if you’re not prepared to come forward with the evidence, sir?"
522	0	"China, now, put on $250 billion, and they’re paying 25 percent on that."
523	0	They’re paying billions and billions.
524	0	This has never happened to China.
525	0	And I like China.
526	0	And I like President Xi a lot.
527	0	I think he’s a friend of mine.
528	0	"He may not be a friend of mine anymore, but he — I think he probably respects —"
529	0	"From what I hear — if you look at Mr. Pillsbury, the leading authority on China — he was on a good show — I won’t mention the name of the show — recently."
530	0	"And he was saying that China has total respect for Donald Trump and for Donald Trump’s very, very large brain."
531	0	"He said, ""Donald. Donald Trump. They don’t know what to do"""
532	0	It never happened.
533	0	"Well, one thing they are trying to do is they are trying to convince people to go against Donald Trump."
534	1	"Because a normal, regular, political person that has no concept of what the hell he’s doing would let China continue to take $500 billion a year out of our country and rebuild their country."
535	0	"I mean, they were building 29 massive bridges like the George Washington Bridge."
536	0	They’re building things that we don’t build anymore.
537	0	But we’re starting to build them again.
538	0	And our economy now is hotter than it’s ever been. I don’t know you if you saw the confidence levels this morning that just came out.
539	0	Fantastic.
540	0	"And in all fairness to the Fed raising rates, they’re raising rates because we’ve never done like we’re doing now."
541	0	"And one of the things that is nice about the rates — the people that were hurt the worst by these zero interest rates and, you know —"
542	0	When President Obama had an economy that was — it was the worst comeback since the Great Depression and all that — you’ve all heard that.
543	0	"But remember, he was playing with zero-interest money."
544	0	He was playing with funny money.
545	0	That’s easy.
546	0	I’m playing with fairly expensive money.
547	0	"So when he does that, the people that benefit are people that actually — in their whole life, they would save 10, 15, 20 percent of their salary and put it in the bank."
548	0	Those people got killed because they put their money in the bank.
549	0	"They were going to live off the interest, and there was no interest."
550	0	"Now, those people are starting to get interest."
551	0	"And those are the people, frankly, that deserve to — you know, they did a great job."
552	0	"The people that did it right, the people that did the best job got hurt the most."
553	0	"So in one sense I like it, but basically I’m a low-interest-rate person."
554	0	I hate to tell you.
555	0	Yes.
556	0	"Yes, ma’am."
557	0	Yes.
558	0	"Yes, go ahead."
559	0	"Mr. President, you have another meeting tomorrow with Rod Rosenstein."
560	0	Yes.
561	0	Are you planning to fire Rod Rosenstein?
562	0	I’m talking to him.
563	0	We’ve had a good talk.
564	0	He said he never said it.
565	0	He said he doesn’t believe it.
566	0	"He said he has a lot of respect for me, and he was very nice and we’ll see."
567	0	"And he’s a member of the Trump administration, in that sense; it’s the Justice Department."
568	0	I would certainly prefer not doing that.
569	0	There was no collusion.
570	0	"There was no obstruction — I mean, unless you call obstruction the fact that I fight back."
571	0	I do fight back.
572	0	I really fight back.
573	0	"I mean, if you call that obstruction, that’s fine."
574	0	But there’s no obstruction.
575	0	There’s no collusion.
576	0	I’m going to meet with him tomorrow.
577	0	"I may call Rod tonight or tomorrow and ask for a little bit of a delay to the meeting, because I don’t want to do anything that gets in the way of this very important Supreme Court pick."
578	0	So I don’t want it competing and hurting the decision — one way or the other decision.
579	0	"Again, I want to hear what she has to say."
580	0	But I want to do — so I may delay that.
581	0	I’m going to see.
582	0	I don’t want to do anything that’s going to conflict with that.
583	0	"But my preference would be to keep him, and to let him finish up."
584	0	"You know, I call it a ""witch hunt"""
585	0	And it is a witch hunt.
586	0	If you look at the FBI statements with Strzok and his lover Lisa Page.
587	0	If you look at all of the things that have gone on in the FBI.
588	1	"If you look at McCabe taking $700,000 from a Hillary Clinton-PAC essentially run by Terry McAuliffe, who’s her best friend in the world, and he gives them hundreds of thousands of dollars."
589	0	"And he’s in charge of her campaign, and his wife is getting all of this money to run — she lost — to run."
590	0	"I mean, what’s going on?"
591	0	"If you look at the horrible statements, like ""Way to go, Page. Great story you put into a newspaper"""
592	0	"Essentially, now we’ll go and investigate that group."
593	0	It’s terrible.
594	0	We have caught people doing things that are terrible.
595	0	I would much prefer keeping Rod Rosenstein.
596	0	Much prefer.
597	0	Many people say I have the right to absolutely fire him.
598	0	He said he did not say it.
599	0	He said he does not believe that.
600	0	And nobody in this room believes it.
601	0	"By the way, I deal with the people in this room."
602	0	"I was with Mike Pompeo before, and we were dealing, at a very high level, with Japan."
603	0	And I was saying things that nobody in the room even understood.
604	0	"And I said them a long time ago, and I was right."
605	0	"He said, ""That’s not the 25th Amendment that I’m looking at"""
606	0	I think I can say that from Mike.
607	0	So you don’t think anyone in your administration has ever discussed using the 25th Amendment against you?
608	0	I don’t think so.
609	0	"Well, yeah — enemies, sure."
610	0	You use anything you can.
611	0	Was it in your administration or your Cabinet?
612	0	"Hey, you use anything they can."
613	0	They’re not in love with me.
614	0	They’re not going to beat me in the election; they know that.
615	0	They’re not going to beat me.
616	0	The people that I’m looking at are total lightweights.
617	0	I dream of running against those people.
618	0	But within your administration?
619	0	Maybe they’ll come up with somebody that’s not — they’re not going to beat me.
620	0	I’m against what they want to do.
621	0	I’m in favor of law enforcement.
622	0	"I’m in favor of safety and security, and low taxes."
623	0	I want low taxes.
624	0	I want borders.
625	1	We’re getting another $1.6 billion in borders.
626	0	I want borders.
627	1	We’ve spent $3.2 [billion] and we’re getting another $1.6 [billion].
628	0	"And then eventually, we’re getting the whole thing and we’ll complete the wall."
629	0	They don’t want that.
630	0	They don’t want that.
631	0	They don’t want the things that I have.
632	0	"Now, I must say, I know many of the Democrats."
633	0	They’ll say things and then wink at me.
634	0	"And again, it’s the same old story."
635	0	They’ll say things; they don’t mean it.
636	0	Its politics.
637	0	The reason they don’t want me is because they want to run the show.
638	0	They want it.
639	0	It’s power.
640	0	It’s whatever you want to call it.
641	0	But what they’ve done here is a disgrace.
642	0	A total disgrace.
643	0	"And what they do — I know, it’s sort of interesting — in one case, they say, ""He’s a fascist. He’s taking over the government. He’s the most powerful President ever. He’s a horrible human being. He wants to take over the entire government, and he’s going to do it. We can’t stop him"""
644	0	That didn’t work.
645	0	"The next week, he said, ""Uh, he’s incompetent"""
646	0	"I said, ""Well, wait a minute"""
647	0	"In one case, I’m taking over the world."
648	0	"And in the other case, ""He’s incompetent"""
649	0	They tried that for a week.
650	0	That didn’t work.
651	0	"Look, these are very dishonest people."
652	0	These are con artists.
653	0	"And the press knows it, but the press doesn’t write it."
654	0	Wow.
655	0	That’s a lot of hands.
656	0	"That’s a lot of — oh, Steve, go ahead."
657	0	"He is a very high quality person, this man."
658	0	But he’ll probably hit me with a bad one.
659	0	(LAUGHTER)
660	0	"Thank you, Mr. President."
661	0	Why —
662	0	Go ahead.
663	0	Give it to me.
664	0	"Give it to me, Steve."
665	0	Reuters.
666	0	You’re getting letters from Chairman Kim.
667	0	Why do you need a second summit with the North Korean leader so soon?
668	0	And what do you —
669	0	Because he’d like it.
670	0	What would it be for?
671	0	So I’ve received two letters from Chairman Kim.
672	0	"At some point, I’ll, you know, give these letters — they’re incredible letters."
673	0	They’re letters that are magnificent in the sense of his feeling for wanting to get this done.
674	0	I really believe he wants to get it done.
675	0	I may be wrong.
676	0	"I heard somebody on a certain network last night — I won’t mention which one — say, ""Why has President Trump given so much to North Korea?"""
677	0	"I said, ""Wait a minute"""
678	0	"I asked Sarah Huckabee, ""Please call this person"""
679	0	I gave nothing — other than I met.
680	0	What did I give them?
681	0	I didn’t do what Obama did:  Give them $1.8 billion in cash to get back four hostages.
682	0	I got back our hostages; I never paid them anything.
683	0	I haven’t paid them 10 cents.
684	0	But he wants to make a deal and I’d like to make a deal.
685	0	We actually have a very good relationship together — a lot different than the last time I was at the United Nations.
686	0	That was a little bit rough.
687	0	"Don’t forget, that time, they said, ""Oh, Trump is saying these horrible things. He’s going to get us into a war"""
688	0	You were going to have a war.
689	0	"If I wasn’t elected, you’d be in war."
690	0	And President Obama essentially said the same thing.
691	0	He was ready to go to war.
692	0	"You would have had a war, and you would have lost millions, not thousands."
693	0	You would have lost millions of people.
694	0	Seoul has 30 million people — 40 miles and 30 miles from this very dangerous border.
695	0	"If I wasn’t elected, you would have had a war."
696	0	President Obama thought you had to go to war.
697	0	You know how close he was to pressing the trigger for war?
698	0	Millions of people.
699	0	"With me, nobody is talking about that."
700	0	Nobody is talking about that.
701	0	We have a very good relationship.
702	0	He likes me.
703	0	I like him.
704	0	We get along.
705	0	He wrote me two of the most beautiful letters.
706	0	"When I showed one of the letters — just one — to Prime Minister Abe, he said, ""This is actually a groundbreaking letter. This is an incredible — this is a historic letter"""
707	0	And it is a historic letter.
708	0	It’s a beautiful — it’s a beautiful piece of art.
709	0	And I think we’re going to make a deal.
710	0	"Will we make a deal, Steve?"
711	0	I don’t really know.
712	0	But I think we’re going to.
713	0	"In the meantime — and I’ve said it a thousand — I don’t want to bore you: no rockets, no missiles, no nuclear tests — you know, for over a year, where you haven’t seen."
714	0	"Before I got here, everybody in this room thought you were going to war."
715	0	"And then what happened — it was funny — they said, ""He was terrible. He was so rough with Chairman Kim — Kim Jong Un. He was so rough. It’s terrible. He’s going to cause…"""
716	0	"Well, I had a great meeting with President Putin."
717	0	"And on that one, they said, ""He was too soft with President Putin"""
718	0	I had a great meeting with the President.
719	0	It lasted for two hours.
720	0	"We discussed everything: Ukraine, Syria, Israel and Israel’s protection."
721	0	We had a great meeting.
722	0	They wanted me to end up in a boxing match.
723	0	And you know what?
724	0	"If I was killer-tough with President Putin, they would have said, ""He was too tough"""
725	0	"You can’t win with these people, but you just keep going."
726	0	"In the meantime, we’re doing well."
727	0	Go ahead.
728	0	So how do you — how long do you —
729	0	Wait.
730	0	One second.
731	0	How long do you think it should take North Korea to denuclearize?
732	0	I don’t know.
733	0	I don’t want to get into —
734	0	"We’ve seen estimates of one year, two year —"
735	0	"Steve, I don’t want to get into the time game."
736	0	You know why?
737	0	"I told Mike Pompeo, I said, ""Mike, don’t get into the time game"""
738	0	We stopped them.
739	0	They’re taking down plants.
740	0	They’re taking down a lot of different testing areas.
741	0	They’re going to take down some more.
742	0	You’ll be hearing about that very soon.
743	0	"I don’t want to go ahead of myself, but you’ll be hearing about it soon."
744	0	They have no interest right now in testing nuclear.
745	0	"You know, we had a case just about when I was coming into office — you all remember it — where there was a massive — they thought it was an earthquake."
746	0	A mountain moved over an inch and a half.
747	0	We’re talking about mountains.
748	0	"You know, North Korea is very mountainous."
749	0	Beautiful land.
750	0	Beautiful.
751	0	This mountain actually shifted.
752	0	It shifted.
753	0	And somebody thought it was an earthquake.
754	0	"And then they found out, no, this was nuclear testing."
755	0	Shifted a mountain.
756	0	Now I’m talking about serious stuff.
757	0	Serious size.
758	0	"When I came in, and certainly before I came in — and even at the beginning of mine because when I was having rhetorical contests — you know, contests, really, I guess you could call it — with Chairman Kim, which we both smile at now and we laugh at."
759	0	But everybody thought that was a horrible thing.
760	0	"We’ve had — many Presidents were unable to do anything, anything at all with North Korea."
761	0	We now have a good relationship.
762	0	We have a good relationship.
763	0	"And most importantly, all of the things that you’ve been hearing about –the horror stories — in my opinion, they’re gone."
764	0	"Now, could they start up again?"
765	0	Yes.
766	0	I’m a deal guy.
767	0	Could they start?
768	0	Yeah.
769	0	Could be that we don’t work it out.
770	0	"I think — I have it right here — I think that what we’ve done behind the scenes, which nobody really knows about — and I don’t blame you for not knowing about, you know, personal letters, private letters."
771	0	But saying they want to get it done.
772	0	We know much more than the media for a change.
773	0	Much more.
774	0	"But if you saw what’s going on behind the scenes, I think you’d very impressed."
775	0	We were a country going to war.
776	0	I really believe that President Obama would admit that he said it’s by far his biggest problem.
777	0	"When I sat with him, prior to going to office — going into office, he said to me that’s by far the biggest problem."
778	0	And he said to me that he was very close to going into war.
779	0	"And millions of people — not — you know, I — they say, ""Oh, thousands of people…"""
780	0	"No, no, no, not thousands."
781	0	Millions of people would have been killed.
782	0	And that could have left — you’re right next to China.
783	0	You’re right — that could have been a world war very easily.
784	0	"Right now, we’re in a great position."
785	0	I don’t want to play the time game.
786	0	"I told Mike Pompeo, ""Don’t let them do that to you"""
787	0	I haven’t given anything.
788	0	"And all of a sudden — we got back, it was a few weeks ago."
789	0	"I think we were back like two and a half months from the summit, which was a great success."
790	0	"And people are screaming, ""What’s taking so long?"""
791	0	"I said, ""Oh, I get it"""
792	0	You got to understand the media.
793	0	I’ve been dealing with the media all my life.
794	0	Too much.
795	0	Too much.
796	0	They’re screaming and I saw that.
797	0	"And our guys were — and not Mike — but our guys were being, ""Oh well, we’re working as fast…"""
798	0	" I said, ""I got all the time in the world. I don’t have to rush it"""
799	0	"There’s no — you know, secession of sanctions."
800	0	We got the sanctions on.
801	0	I didn’t take any sanctions off.
802	0	"I did see a reporter last night — a guy I like, personally, a lot."
803	0	And he asked a question to President Moon of South Korea.
804	0	"He said, ""Why did the President give so much?"""
805	0	I didn’t give anything.
806	0	I gave nothing.
807	0	"What have I given, other than some time?"
808	0	"Yes, I flew to Singapore."
809	0	We had a meeting.
810	0	"Now, giving would be if I took the sanctions off."
811	0	"I didn’t want to do — if you asked General Mattis, for a year and a half, I said, ""Why don’t we stop these ridiculous,"" in my opinion, ""the military games?"""
812	0	"I call them the ""military games"""
813	0	"If I told you how much those games cost — and, frankly, I told South Korea, ""You should be paying for these games"""
814	0	We pay for them.
815	0	"They say, ""Well, we fly the planes in from a short distance away"""
816	0	"I said, ""Where is that?"""
817	0	Guam
818	0	"Oh, huh."
819	0	How long a trip is that?
820	0	Seven hours
821	0	"Oh, great"
822	0	We’re flying these massive bombers and everything.
823	0	I’ve wanted to stop this for a long time.
824	0	I consider that an asset.
825	0	"But we’ve done — we’re saving, by the way — just for the taxpayer, we’re saving a fortune."
826	0	"And if we need them, we can start them up immediately."
827	0	"If I think we need them, I’ll start them before the generals will start them."
828	0	"The fact is, this reporter said that."
829	0	"I said, ""What have we done? I haven’t given anything"""
830	0	And we’re really onto the cusp.
831	0	I think we’re really going to do something that’s going to be very important.
832	0	But we’re not playing the time game.
833	0	"If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter."
834	0	There’s no nuclear testing and there’s no testing of rockets.
835	0	"Yes, ma’am."
836	0	Go ahead.
837	0	Go ahead.
838	0	Please.
839	0	Thank you.
840	0	"This is the one that was nodding with every nice thing I said, so watch this question."
841	0	It’s a habit of mine.
842	0	Hannah Thomas-Peter from Sky News.
843	0	You’re with who?
844	0	Hannah Thomas-Peter from Sky News.
845	0	"Okay, good."
846	0	Sky News.
847	0	"Thank you, Mr. President."
848	0	Congratulations on the purchase.
849	0	(LAUGHTER)
850	0	Nothing to do with me.
851	0	I hope you benefited.
852	0	(LAUGHTER)
853	0	Go ahead.
854	0	"Are you at all concerned at the message that has been sending — being sent to the women who are watching this when you use language like ""con job"" in relation to allegations of sexual assault?"
855	0	"Oh, I’ve used much worse language in my life than ""con job"""
856	0	That’s like probably the nicest phrase I’ve ever used.
857	0	"I mean, con job — it is."
858	0	It’s a con job.
859	0	"You know, confidence — it’s a confidence job."
860	0	But they short — it’s a con job by the Democrats.
861	0	They know it.
862	0	What about the message that’s being sent to women who are watching?
863	0	They did the same thing with the Russia investigation.
864	0	They tried to convince people that I had something to do with Russia.
865	0	There was no collusion.
866	0	Think of it.
867	0	I’m in Wisconsin.
868	0	I’m in Michigan.
869	0	"I say, ""Gee, we’re not doing well"""
870	0	I won both those states.
871	0	We’re not doing well.
872	0	"Uh, let me call the Russians to help"
873	0	Does anybody really believe that?
874	0	It’s a con job.
875	0	"And I watch these guys — Little Adam Schiff, and all of the guys."
876	0	He takes a call from a Russian who turned out to be a faker.
877	0	"You know, he was a comedian or something."
878	0	This is so-and-so calling for… — he took the call.
879	0	Why is the taking a call from a Russian?
880	0	Senator Warner took a call from a Russian.
881	0	"He was a comedian or something, but he said, ""We have pictures of President Trump"""
882	0	"Oh, where can I get them?  If we ever did that, it would be like a big deal."
883	0	"Yeah, it’s a con job."
884	0	And it’s not a bad term.
885	0	It’s not a bad term at all.
886	0	Are you worried —
887	0	"I’ll tell you one thing I can say: I’ve had a lot of people talking about this to me, with respect to what’s happening, because it’s a horrible precedent."
888	0	"I’m going to have to get other judges and other Supreme Court judges, possibly."
889	0	"I could have a lot of the Supreme Court judges, more than two."
890	0	"And when I called up Brett Kavanaugh — spoke to him and his family — and told them that I chose them, they were so happy and so honored."
891	0	"It was as though — I mean, the biggest thing that’s ever happened."
892	0	And I understand that — U.S. Supreme Court.
893	0	"I don’t want to be in a position where people say, ""No, thanks. No, thanks. I don’t want to"""
894	0	"You know, ""I spoke to somebody 38 years ago, and it may not be good"""
895	0	We have a country to run.
896	0	We want the best talent in the world.
897	0	But I’ll tell you this:  The people that have complained to me about it the most — about what’s happening — are women.
898	0	Women are very angry.
899	0	"You know, I got 52 percent with women."
900	0	"Everyone said, ""This couldn’t happen — 52 percent"""
901	0	Women are so angry.
902	0	"And I, frankly, think that — I think they like what the Republicans are doing, but I think they would have liked to have seen it go a lot faster."
903	0	But give them their day in court.
904	0	Let her have her day in court.
905	0	Let somebody else have a day in court.
906	0	"But the ones that I find — I mean, I have men that don’t like it, but I have women that are incensed at what’s going on."
907	0	I’ve always said women are smarter than men.
908	0	I’ve said that a lot and I mean it.
909	0	But women are incensed at what’s going on.
910	0	"Yes, go ahead."
911	0	Go ahead.
912	0	Go ahead.
913	0	"Go ahead, in the back."
914	0	Sorry.
915	0	It’s me?
916	0	Who are you?
917	0	Or where are you from?
918	0	It’s me?
919	0	It’s me?
920	0	"Yeah, you."
921	0	(LAUGHTER)
922	0	The guy looks — guy looks like he’s shocked.
923	0	That’s not — this is going to be not good.
924	0	"It’s going to be good, sir."
925	0	The guy looks totally like stunned that I — have you ever been picked before for a question?
926	0	(LAUGHTER)
927	0	"Yes, sir, but not from President of the United States."
928	0	Go ahead.
929	0	Go ahead.
930	0	Give me a question.
931	0	Thank you very much.
932	0	My name is Majeed Gly from Rudaw Media Network.
933	0	"I want to, sir, ask you — you always talk about —"
934	0	"Excuse me, you said where?"
935	0	From where?
936	0	"Rudaw Media Network from Kurdistan region, north of Iraq."
937	0	Okay.
938	0	I’m a Kurd.
939	0	Sir —
940	0	Good.
941	0	Good.
942	0	Great people.
943	0	"Thank you, sir."
944	0	Great people.
945	0	(Inaudible.)
946	0	Thank you.
947	0	Thank you.
948	0	Mr. President.
949	0	"Mr. President, I want to —"
950	0	Thank you.
951	0	Are you a Kurd?
952	0	(Inaudible.)
953	0	Good.
954	0	Mr. President —
955	0	They’re great people.
956	0	They’re great fighters.
957	0	I like them a lot.
958	0	Let’s go.
959	0	I like this question so far.
960	0	"Mr. President, you always say you support your allies."
961	0	"Kurds right now, after the defeat of ISIS, are under a lot of pressure in Syria and in Iraq by many adversaries."
962	0	It’s true.
963	0	What will you do to elevate their position to support them in order — after they help the United States to defeat ISIS?
964	0	Thank you very much.
965	0	"Well, we are helping them a lot and we’ve been very friendly with them."
966	0	"And, as you know, we’ve fought side-by-side."
967	0	"And we have defeated ISIS, essentially, a very short while ago, in the Middle East."
968	0	And we did it with a lot of help from the Kurds.
969	0	And they are — they’re great fighters.
970	0	"You know, some people are great fighters and some people aren’t."
971	0	The Kurds are great fighters.
972	0	"And they’re great, great people."
973	0	And we’re going to be working — we’re discussing that situation exactly right now.
974	0	"What will you do to support them, sir, (inaudible) Syria?"
975	0	"Well, I’m just telling you, we’re going to be discussing that situation."
976	0	We have already started discussing that situation.
977	0	But we have tremendous support from the Kurds in defeating ISIS.
978	0	Okay?
979	0	"And about Syria:  Sir, in your speech you did not mention —"
980	0	"Uh, yes."
981	0	Go.
982	0	Uh oh.
983	0	Here we go.
984	0	(LAUGHTER)
985	0	You don’t need it.
986	0	"Mr. President, Susan Li from Fox Business."
987	0	Did you reject a one-on-one meeting with the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau?
988	0	"Yeah, I did."
989	0	Why?
990	0	"Because his tariffs are too high, and he doesn’t seem to want to move, and I’ve told him, ""Forget about it"""
991	0	"And frankly, we’re thinking about just taxing cars coming in from Canada."
992	0	That’s the motherlode.
993	0	That’s the big one.
994	0	We’re very unhappy with the negotiations and the negotiating style of Canada.
995	0	We don’t like their representative very much.
996	0	"They’ve taken advantage — I love Canada, by the way."
997	0	I have so many friends.
998	0	"I have everybody, and so many friends."
999	0	But that has nothing to do with this; I’m representing the United States.
1000	0	"Mexico was totally — I mean, they were great."
1001	0	"By the way, the new President has been great."
1002	0	The deal is done.
1003	0	"Now, it has to go through Congress and, you know, a lot things have to happen."
1004	0	"But we’ve done — Bob Lighthizer, who’s here someplace."
1005	0	Where’s Bob?
1006	0	Bob.
1007	0	"Bob Lighthizer has done a great job of negotiating, as they have."
1008	0	But the deal is done.
1009	0	It’s up to Congress.
1010	0	"And, Mr. President —"
1011	0	But Canada has treated us very badly.
1012	0	"They’ve treated our farmers in Wisconsin, and New York state, and a lot of other states very badly."
1013	1	Dairy products — 300 percent.
1014	1	Three hundred percent.
1015	0	How do you sell a dairy product at 300 percent?
1016	0	The answer is:  You don’t.
1017	0	"What it is, is a barrier."
1018	1	"It’s — basically, they’re saying, ""We don’t have any barriers. By the way, it’s 300 percent"""
1019	0	"So you don’t send it in, because you can’t compete."
1020	0	So Canada has a long way to go.
1021	0	"I must be honest with you, we’re not getting along at all with their negotiators."
1022	0	We think their negotiators have taken advantage of our country for a long time.
1023	0	We had people that didn’t know what they were doing.
1024	0	"And that’s why we had — over the last five or six years, if you average it out, we had $800 billion a year in trade losses."
1025	0	It’s ridiculous.
1026	0	It’s not going to happen.
1027	0	What about NAFTA?
1028	0	"Sir, Mr. President, NAFTA —"
1029	0	Go ahead.
1030	0	What does that mean for NAFTA?
1031	0	Will you be pulling out of NAFTA?
1032	0	I don’t like NAFTA.
1033	0	I never liked it.
1034	0	It’s been very bad for the United States.
1035	0	It’s been great for Canada.
1036	0	It’s been great for Mexico.
1037	0	Very bad for us.
1038	0	But will you pull out of the —
1039	0	"I’m not going to use the name ""NAFTA"""
1040	0	I refuse to use it.
1041	0	I’ve seen thousands of plants and factories close.
1042	0	I’ve seen millions of jobs lost to auto companies that moved.
1043	0	"I mean, Mexico has 25 percent of our auto business now because of NAFTA."
1044	0	"Under our deal, it’s not going to happen anymore."
1045	0	"I hate to tell you, it’s not."
1046	0	We’re going to keep companies.
1047	0	"And I told the Mexicans, I said, ""We have to keep companies"""
1048	0	"But they’re getting a lot, also."
1049	0	They’re getting other things.
1050	0	They’re getting a lot of good things.
1051	0	Mexico made a very good deal.
1052	0	"But with Canada, it’s very tough."
1053	0	"What we’re doing is if we made a deal with Canada — which is, you know, a good chance still."
1054	0	But I’m not making anything near what they want to do.
1055	0	We’re going to be fair.
1056	0	But you’re — are you going to notify Congress of pulling out of NAFTA?
1057	0	"What we’re probably going to do is call it the ""USMC"""
1058	0	"Like the United States Marine Corps, which I love."
1059	0	General Kelly likes it even more.
1060	0	Where’s General Kelly?
1061	0	He likes that.
1062	0	"USMC — which would be U.S., Mexico, Canada."
1063	0	"But it’ll probably or possibly be just ""USM"""
1064	0	It’ll be United States and Mexico.
1065	0	"Yes or no, are you going to —"
1066	0	Canada will come along.
1067	0	"Now, if Canada doesn’t make a deal with us, we’re going to make a much better deal."
1068	0	We’re going to tax the cars that come in.
1069	0	We will put billions and billions of dollars into our Treasury.
1070	0	"And frankly, we’ll be very happy because it’s actually more money than you can make, under any circumstance, with making a deal."
1071	0	Okay?
1072	0	"Good job, too."
1073	0	You do a very good job.
1074	0	Really good.
1075	0	"Yes, please."
1076	0	Mr. Kurd.
1077	0	"Thank you, Mr. President."
1078	0	(LAUGHTER)
1079	0	(Inaudible.)
1080	0	Go ahead.
1081	0	"Thank you very much for your time, Mr. President."
1082	0	"Two, quickly, questions:  What will be the U.S.A. relations with the Kurds —"
1083	0	"Oh, I thought I just answered that."
1084	0	— post-ISIS.
1085	0	Post-ISIS.
1086	0	Okay.
1087	0	We’re trying to get along very well.
1088	0	We do get along great with the Kurds.
1089	0	We’re trying to help them a lot.
1090	0	"Don’t forget, that’s their territory."
1091	0	(Inaudible.)
1092	0	We have to help them.
1093	0	I want to help them.
1094	0	"Go ahead, what’s next?"
1095	0	"Then, what —"
1096	0	They fought with us.
1097	0	They fought with us.
1098	0	They died with us.
1099	0	They died.
1100	0	We lost — tens of thousands of Kurds died fighting ISIS.
1101	0	They died for us and with us.
1102	0	And for themselves.
1103	0	They died for themselves.
1104	0	But they’re great people.
1105	0	And we have not forget — we don’t forget — I don’t forget.
1106	0	What happens someday later — but I can tell you that I don’t forget.
1107	0	These are great people.
1108	0	Okay.
1109	0	"Yes, ma’am."
1110	0	Please.
1111	0	Please —
1112	0	"About Iran, Mr. President."
1113	0	"About Iran, one question: What is your clear plan to stop Iranian influence in Iraq, in Syria, and especially in Iraqi Kurdistan?"
1114	0	"Well, I think you’ve seen that."
1115	0	"I must tell you, it’s — I don’t mind your question because —"
1116	0	"Raheem Rashidi, from Kurdistan TV."
1117	0	Thank you.
1118	0	"I think there’s been no greater change — other than maybe China, because China — unfortunately, their markets have dropped — would you say, 30 percent in the last four months, right?"
1119	0	I think I watched you recently when you said that.
1120	0	"I said, ""I think she’s wrong. I think it’s actually 32. But that’s okay"""
1121	0	But a lot.
1122	0	"There’s been no — other than maybe that, but even that."
1123	0	Because China is a very special place.
1124	0	And Iran is a very special place.
1125	0	But I think there’s been no country that’s changed so much as Iran.
1126	0	"In the last six months, since I took off the horrible, horrible Iran nuclear deal, as they called it — one of the dumbest deals ever made."
1127	0	"As an example, why didn’t they take care of Yemen in the deal?"
1128	0	Why didn’t they take care of Syria in the deal?
1129	0	You know what Kerry said — the reason?
1130	0	It was too complicated.
1131	0	"We’re giving $150 billion, we paid $1.8 billion in cash — cash."
1132	0	This whole room would be filled up with hundred-dollar bills.
1133	0	And you’d need probably five rooms like this.
1134	0	But you have $1.8 billion in cash.
1135	0	Why didn’t we take care of Yemen?
1136	0	Why didn’t we take care of Syria and other?
1137	0	"And he said, ""Because it was too complicated"""
1138	0	"Well, you just gave all your cards."
1139	0	You gave them $150 billion.
1140	0	"And now Yemen’s a mess, but it’s getting better."
1141	0	And Syria’s a mess.
1142	0	"And I was responsible — and I hope it stays that way — when I put out on social media, a few weeks ago, about Idlib Province."
1143	0	"I said, ""Don’t do it"""
1144	0	"And I’ll tell you, it happened — where I was at a meeting with a lot of supporters, and a woman stood up and she said, ""There’s a province in Syria with 3 million people. Right now, the Iranians, the Russians, and the Syrians are surrounding their province. And they’re going to kill my sister. And they’re going to kill millions of people in order to get rid of 25,000 or 35,000 terrorists or enemies of theirs"""
1145	0	But I think we can call them terrorists.
1146	0	"And I said, ""That’s not going to happen"""
1147	0	I didn’t hear of Idlib Province.
1148	0	"And I came back to New York, and I picked up the failing New York Times — I hate to admit it was the New York Times, but it was the failing New York Times."
1149	0	"And I opened it up — not on the front page, but there was a very big story."
1150	0	"I said, ""Wow, that’s the same story that the woman told me that I found hard to believe"""
1151	0	Because why would — how would anyone do that with 3 million people?
1152	0	"And it said that they were being surrounded, and they were going in and starting — literally, the next day, they were going to drop bombs all over the place and perhaps kill millions of people in order to get 35,000 terrorists."
1153	0	"And I put out on social media and elsewhere — I gave Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, everybody these orders: ""Don’t let it happen"""
1154	0	"I said, ""Don’t let it happen"""
1155	0	That doesn’t mean they can’t be selective.
1156	0	"They can’t be — you know, go in and they’ve got to do what they’ve got to do with terrorists."
1157	0	I assume they’re terrorists.
1158	0	But don’t kill millions of people.
1159	0	And it stopped.
1160	0	You saw that.
1161	0	"Nobody’s going to give me credit, but that’s okay."
1162	0	That’s okay.
1163	0	Because the people the people know.
1164	0	I have had more Syrians thank me for that.
1165	0	"This was about four weeks ago, I put that out."
1166	0	"I said, ""They’re surrounding a city of 3 million people. They’re going to start bombing the city. Don’t let it happen"""
1167	0	"And I meant it, too."
1168	0	I meant it.
1169	0	And millions of people have been saved.
1170	0	"And I gave, today, great credit to Iran."
1171	0	I don’t know if you heard that.
1172	0	"I gave great credit to Iran, to Russia, and to Syria for not doing it."
1173	0	Now I hope it’s going to be surgical — meaning go in and do — it’s lengthy and everything else.
1174	0	And they possibly have to do it.
1175	0	But I think millions of people would have been killed.
1176	0	And that would have been a shame.
1177	0	"And hopefully — and I have to tell you, Turkey has been a big help."
1178	0	Turkey has been great.
1179	0	Turkey has helped us very much with that whole situation.
1180	0	Mr. President.
1181	0	Yes.
1182	0	Yes.
1183	0	"Thank you, Mr. President."
1184	0	Good.
1185	0	Thank you very much.
1186	0	"Touching back on Iran: Of course, this week, you put out a call to action to other countries to rally with America, to put pressure on Iran."
1187	0	Rouhani is still calling for the U.S. to come back into the old deal.
1188	0	"But after meeting with world leaders this week, did you make any progress towards a potential new deal?"
1189	0	Doesn’t matter what world leaders think on Iran.
1190	0	"Iran’s going to come back to me and they’re going to make a good deal, I think."
1191	0	Maybe not.
1192	0	Deals — you never know.
1193	0	But they’re suffering greatly.
1194	1	"They’re having riots in every city, far greater than they were during the green period with President Obama."
1195	0	Far greater.
1196	1	"When President Obama stuck up for government, not the people."
1197	0	You probably would have had a much different Iran had he not done that.
1198	0	But I’m sticking up for the people.
1199	0	I am with the people of Iran.
1200	0	But here’s the thing:  They have rampant inflation.
1201	0	Their money is worthless.
1202	0	Everything is going wrong.
1203	0	They have riots in the street.
1204	0	You can’t buy bread.
1205	0	You can’t do anything.
1206	0	It’s a disaster.
1207	0	"At some point, I think they’re going to want to come back, and they’re going to say, ""Hey, can we do something?"""
1208	0	And I’m very simple; I just don’t want them to have nuclear weapons.
1209	0	That’s all.
1210	0	Is that too much to ask?
1211	0	I don’t want them to have nuclear weapons.
1212	0	I want them to have a great economy.
1213	0	I want them to sell so much oil so that the oil prices — I’m not happy with OPEC.
1214	0	"I told them, ""I’m not happy with OPEC"""
1215	0	"We take care of all these people, we defend them."
1216	0	"They wouldn’t be there for two weeks if it wasn’t for me, and the United States, and a much stronger armed forces than it was."
1217	0	Because our armed forces was depleted.
1218	0	We had old equipment.
1219	0	"Now, we have — hey, you know better than anybody — $700 billion and $716 billion."
1220	0	We have the most incredible new jets and everything.
1221	0	We need it.
1222	0	"Not that I want to spend it, although it is jobs."
1223	0	It’s all made in the United States.
1224	0	"But Iran has to come back, and they have to talk."
1225	0	And I’m not doing this from strength or weakness.
1226	0	"I’m just saying, at some point, I think they’re going to have to come back."
1227	0	"If you look at what’s going on, companies are leaving left and right."
1228	0	Mercedes Benz just left.
1229	0	They’re all leaving.
1230	0	They don’t want to be in Iran.
1231	0	"Because they have a choice: Do they want to be with Iran, or do they want to be with us?"
1232	0	"And we have, by — we picked up $10 trillion since my election."
1233	0	We were being caught by China.
1234	0	Now it’s going the other way.
1235	0	People can’t believe it.
1236	0	People have never seen this situation with China.
1237	0	"Everything’s always been — for 20 years, ""Oh, China is so great. China is so great"""
1238	0	You don’t hear that so much anymore.
1239	0	I love China; I think they’re great.
1240	0	But you don’t hear that so much anymore.
1241	0	You know who’s great now?
1242	0	We’re great now.
1243	0	"Okay, how about just a couple more."
1244	0	"Now, I could be doing — I could be doing this all day long."
1245	0	I could be doing this all day long.
1246	0	Should we continue for a little while?
1247	0	It doesn’t matter to me.
1248	0	A couple of more.
1249	0	I don’t care.
1250	0	"New York Times, come on."
1251	0	New York Times.
1252	0	The failing New York Times.
1253	0	Stand up.
1254	0	Go ahead.
1255	0	"You’re talking about me, but (inaudible)."
1256	0	"No, I’m talking about the Times is failing."
1257	0	You are far from failing.
1258	0	Go ahead.
1259	0	"Okay, but you’re not — you were pointing to me, so you meant me."
1260	0	But I —
1261	0	"The Times are very interesting, though."
1262	0	"The Times, I think they’re going to endorse me."
1263	0	(LAUGHTER)
1264	0	"I think that ABC — I think — well, Fox — I like Fox."
1265	0	I really do.
1266	0	Just to be sure —
1267	0	"But I think ABC, CBS, NBC, the Times, the — they’re all going to endorse me, because if they don’t, they’re going out of business."
1268	0	Can you imagine if you didn’t have me?
1269	0	"Go ahead, what would you like to say?"
1270	0	"Just to be sure, I know you were pointing to me, but I work for PBS NewsHour."
1271	0	I know that.
1272	0	"No, I know that."
1273	0	(LAUGHTER)
1274	0	Okay.
1275	0	"So, I want to ask you: Yesterday, you were talking about your administration’s accomplishments at the United Nations, and a lot of the leaders laughed."
1276	0	Why do you think they were laughing?
1277	0	"Well, that’s fake news."
1278	0	And what was that experience like for you?
1279	0	Yeah.
1280	0	It was fake news.
1281	0	And it was covered that way.
1282	0	Okay.
1283	0	"So, I said that, since my election, our economy has become the hottest in the world."
1284	0	"Tax reductions, regulations, confidence levels are the highest in 18 years — really, soon to be historic."
1285	0	Unemployment is the lowest in the history of our country.
1286	0	You look at Black unemployment.
1287	0	You look at Asian unemployment.
1288	0	You look at women — 65 years.
1289	0	The unemployment numbers are among the best we’ve ever had ever.
1290	0	"The numbers of new companies pouring into our country, which nobody thought was possible."
1291	0	And I said this.
1292	0	"And I was in front of a large group of highly professional people, most of whom are from either other countries or the United Nations — people that aren’t big into clapping, applauding, smiling."
1293	0	"And I heard a little rustle, as I said our country is now stronger than ever before."
1294	0	It’s true.
1295	0	"I mean, it is true."
1296	0	And I heard a little rustle.
1297	0	"And I said, ""It’s true"""
1298	0	And I heard smiles.
1299	0	"And I said, ""Oh, I didn’t know there there’d be that kind…"""
1300	0	They weren’t laughing at me.
1301	0	They were laughing with me.
1302	0	We had fun.
1303	0	That was not laughing at me.
1304	0	"So the fake news said, ""People laughed at President Trump"""
1305	0	They didn’t laugh at me.
1306	0	People had a good time with me.
1307	0	We were doing it together.
1308	0	We had a good time.
1309	0	They respect what I’ve done.
1310	0	The United States is respected again.
1311	0	The United States was not respected.
1312	0	Everybody was taking advantage of us.
1313	0	"From jobs, and taking our companies, and not paying the price — to so many other things, even military protection."
1314	0	"I told a number of countries over the last few days, I said, ""Listen, you’re a very rich country. We protect you. Without our protection, you would have real problems. You would have real problems."""
1315	0	And I — I want to —
1316	0	"I said, ""You should reimburse us for this protection. Why are we protecting you?"""
1317	0	And do you want to know what they said after about two minutes of talking?
1318	0	They agreed with me.
1319	0	And you can ask this group of very talented people — they agreed with me.
1320	0	"But they said — one of them said, ""But Mr. President, nobody ever asked us for that. They never asked us for that"""
1321	0	"Nobody has ever said, ""You should pay"""
1322	0	These are really wealthy countries.
1323	0	"I mean, I’ll be honest, I just asked Japan."
1324	0	"I said, ""We’re defending you. You’re a very wealthy country. You’re sending us millions of cars. We have a tremendous trade deficit with you. And we’re defending you, and we’re subsidizing your military with a massive amount of money."""
1325	0	I said it to South Korea.
1326	0	"We have 32,000 soldiers in South Korea."
1327	0	They’re a very wealthy — these are great countries.
1328	0	These are very wealthy countries.
1329	0	"I said, ""Why aren’t you reimbursing us for our costs?"""
1330	0	And you know what?
1331	0	"They look at me, and they can’t even answer it, because there’s no answer."
1332	0	"If they’re a poor country and they needed protection, and people were going to die, I’m all for protecting them; I don’t want 10 cents."
1333	0	"But when wealthy countries that have massive trade surpluses with us — massive — and then on top of that, we’re paying for their military?"
1334	0	Or we’re paying for a lot of their military?
1335	0	That doesn’t work.
1336	0	"How about two more, and we’ll call it?"
1337	0	"Mr. President, really quickly."
1338	0	"Mr. President, you said you feel a kinship — you said you feel a kinship with Brett Kavanaugh and you — Mr. President, really quickly, you said you felt a kinship with Brett Kavanaugh."
1339	0	You said that you also — your false allegations that you feel like were made against you make you feel like you don’t want to believe these women.
1340	0	What message do you think that —
1341	0	"No, I didn’t say that."
1342	0	Why do you say that?
1343	0	"So, please explain —"
1344	0	Fake news.
1345	0	Please explain —
1346	0	Why — did I say that?
1347	0	"Well, can you please explain then what you’re talking about in your own false allegations?"
1348	0	Excuse me.
1349	0	"And by the way, I think you do a very good job, but I didn’t say that."
1350	0	I do watch you.
1351	0	And I think you do a very good job.
1352	0	But I didn’t say that.
1353	0	So could you explain what you meant?
1354	0	"I said, exactly, ""I look forward to watching her"""
1355	0	I do want to hear what she says.
1356	0	And maybe she’ll say — I could be convinced of anything.
1357	0	"Maybe, if she’ll say something — but in the meantime, I have to tell you, he’s one of the highest quality human beings."
1358	0	He’s a tremendous man.
1359	0	He’s a tremendous genius.
1360	0	He’s a great intellect.
1361	0	"He was, I believe, number one at Yale."
1362	0	Is that a correct statement?
1363	0	Number one in his class at Yale.
1364	0	So you don’t feel a kinship with him?
1365	0	He was a great student in law.
1366	0	"He was — you know, I’ve heard his name."
1367	0	I didn’t know him.
1368	0	Didn’t know him.
1369	0	"Until this whole thing, I didn’t know him."
1370	0	But I heard his name for 10 years.
1371	0	And you know how I heard his name?
1372	0	Everybody was saying he should be on the Supreme Court.
1373	0	"I said, ""Who is he?"""
1374	0	His name is Brett Kavanaugh. And he should be — he’s the most brilliant person. He’s the most brilliant lawyer
1375	0	They were talking about him on the Supreme Court 10 years ago.
1376	0	"With all of that, I want to hear what she has to say."
1377	0	Okay?
1378	0	"But you said that you don’t feel — but you said that you feel like there have been numerous false allegations against you, and that because of that–"
1379	0	"Oh, I’ve had many false —"
1380	0	— you feel that you understand what he might be going through.
1381	0	I’ve had many false statements against me.
1382	0	"And if the press would have reported it, I would have been very happy."
1383	0	I think John Roberts would tell you that — you covered the story where the women were paid to say bad things about me.
1384	0	Sean Hannity covered it.
1385	0	"I will tell you, when I saw that on Sean Hannity, I actually called him."
1386	0	"Believe it or not, I don’t speak to him very much, but I respect him."
1387	0	I called him.
1388	0	"I said, ""This is the biggest story. This is a big, big story"""
1389	0	He agreed with me.
1390	0	"The next day, I picked up the papers."
1391	0	There wasn’t one word about it.
1392	0	"The next day, I watched ABC news."
1393	0	"John, I watched NBC."
1394	0	I watched CBS.
1395	0	"I didn’t watch CNN, but, next time, I’m going to."
1396	0	(LAUGHTER)
1397	0	And are you okay with —
1398	0	I watched everything.
1399	0	There wasn’t one story other than Fox.
1400	0	And it’s a big story.
1401	0	It’s a shame.
1402	0	Okay.
1403	0	Enough.
1404	0	"Thank you, though."
1405	0	And is it okay if I give it to the New York Times?
1406	0	Thank you.
1407	0	Thank you.
1408	0	"Is it okay if I give it to the New York Times, Mr. President?"
1409	0	Go ahead.
1410	0	"That’s enough, please."
1411	0	I’m just going to — okay.
1412	0	Good job.
1413	0	Good job.
1414	0	"Mr. President, could I ask a question, since I am from the New York Times —"
1415	0	Mr. President —
1416	0	— before this gentleman?
1417	0	Since you’re where?
1418	0	Since you’re where?
1419	0	I’m actually from the New York Times.
1420	0	"Yamiche is my former colleague, and we miss her."
1421	0	But I was hoping I could ask a question.
1422	0	I don’t blame you.
1423	0	But I’ll let you do it after he does it.
1424	0	Is that okay?
1425	0	That’s perfectly well.
1426	0	I will do that in honor of a paper I once loved.
1427	0	(LAUGHTER)
1428	0	Thank you.
1429	0	Go ahead.
1430	0	"Mr. President, my name is Edward Szall, with TruNews."
1431	0	"Today, you met with Bibi Netanyahu, from Israel."
1432	0	"And you brought up, actually, that you support a two-state solution for the Palestinian-Israeli crisis there."
1433	0	I do.
1434	0	"Can you give us any more preview of what this great deal, the peace deal (inaudible) —"
1435	0	"Well, I’d love to be able to make a deal with the Israelis and the Palestinians."
1436	0	"You know, my whole life, I was told that’s the toughest deal."
1437	0	And I disagree.
1438	0	"I think healthcare is probably tougher, okay?"
1439	0	You want to know the truth.
1440	0	But it is tough.
1441	0	"But we’re going to take care of that, too."
1442	0	And that’s going to get taken care of.
1443	0	We’ve already taken care of a lot of it.
1444	0	"But the whole — my life, I’ve always heard the deal between, as you know, Israel and the Palestinians, that’s like the toughest deal."
1445	0	Every possible thing is tough about that.
1446	0	I think we’re going to make a deal.
1447	0	I think we’re going to make a deal.
1448	0	"So, at one of our many meetings today, I was with Bibi Netanyahu, a man who I have a lot of respect for."
1449	0	"A man who has been extremely nice to me — very happy that I did the whole thing with Jerusalem and the embassy, which, by the way, we’re going to open in four months for less than $500,000."
1450	0	"And the budget was over $1 billion, right?"
1451	0	Yes.
1452	0	That’s correct.
1453	0	"So we saved, let’s say, a billion dollars."
1454	0	That’s not so bad.
1455	0	And it’s open.
1456	0	"And it’s beautiful, by the way."
1457	0	"Jerusalem stone, one of my favorite stones."
1458	0	"I will tell you, the question — somebody said today, ""Well, this is the first news conference in a long time"""
1459	0	"I said, ""What do you mean? I did like, five today"""
1460	0	"Every time I sit, I take a lot of questions from people that are screaming like maniacs in the back of the room — meaning, reporters."
1461	0	"And one of the reporters — I won’t say that it was John Roberts that said that, I refuse."
1462	0	"But one of the — it was, but that’s okay."
1463	0	"Don’t feel guilty, John."
1464	0	"But of the reporters that was screaming asked about the one-state, two-state."
1465	0	"And I said, ""I think the two-state will happen. I think it’s, in one way, more difficult because it’s a real estate deal — because you need metes and bounds, and you need lots of carveouts and lots of everything."""
1466	0	"I think it’s, in one way, more difficult because it’s a real estate deal — because you need metes and bounds, and you need lots of carveouts and lots of everything."
1467	0	It’s actually a little tougher deal.
1468	0	"But in another way, it works better because you have people governing themselves."
1469	0	"So, they asked be about that."
1470	0	"I said, ""Well, I think the two-state will happen. I think we’re going to go down the two-state road"""
1471	0	And I’m glad I got it out.
1472	0	"And Jared, who is so involved — he loves Israel."
1473	0	He loves Israel.
1474	0	But he’s also going to be very fair with the Palestinians.
1475	0	He understands it takes two people to be happy — two groups of people to be happy.
1476	0	Everybody has got to be happy.
1477	0	"And that’s why it’s so tough, because there’s been so much hatred and anger for so many years."
1478	0	"That’s what, probably, the number-one ingredient of toughness is."
1479	0	But they asked me — I said I think it’s going to be a two-state.
1480	0	And you know what I did today?
1481	0	"By saying that, I put it out there."
1482	0	"And if you ask most of the people in Israel, they agree with that."
1483	0	But nobody wanted to say it.
1484	0	It’s a big thing to put it out.
1485	0	It’s a very big thing to put it out.
1486	0	"Now, the bottom line: If the Israelis and the Palestinians want one state, that’s okay with me."
1487	0	"If they want two states, that’s okay with me."
1488	0	I’m happy if they’re happy.
1489	0	I’m a facilitator.
1490	0	I want to see if I can get a deal done so that people don’t get killed anymore.
1491	0	"When we had — in Saudi Arabia, we had one of the great conferences in history."
1492	0	Many of you were there; probably all of you were there.
1493	0	It was one of the most beautiful two days.
1494	0	"That, and China — two of the most incredible events I’ve ever seen."
1495	0	I’ve never seen anything like it.
1496	0	"And we had, I believe, 58 Muslim countries — the leaders."
1497	0	"The kings, the emirs, the absolute leaders from every — there was nobody in second place."
1498	0	They were the leaders of the whole thing.
1499	0	"And unbeknownst to anybody else, people would come up to me, individually — it wasn’t a setup."
1500	0	"They’d come up to me and say, ""Sir, you can’t have peace in the Middle East without peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians"""
1501	0	"I said, ""Why? What difference? Why does that matter so much?"""
1502	0	"They said, ""It just is impossible to make peace in the Middle East unless you have between the Israelis…"""
1503	0	"So, I heard that from one — the King of Saudi Arabia, who is a great guy — King Salman."
1504	0	"And then, somebody else came up."
1505	0	"And he wasn’t told, ""Oh, go up and say it"""
1506	0	I know where they’re coming from.
1507	0	And I must have had 12 leaders say it.
1508	0	And they just said it.
1509	0	"And I started to realize that peace between Israel and the Palestinians, for the Middle East, is a very important thing."
1510	0	And we’re trying very hard to get it.
1511	0	"I think, probably, two-state is more likely."
1512	0	But you know what?
1513	0	"If they do a single, if they do a double, I’m okay with it if they’re both happy."
1514	0	"If they’re both happy, I’m okay with either."
1515	0	I think the two-state is more likely.
1516	0	"Okay, how about one — go ahead."
1517	0	New York Times?
1518	0	New York Times?
1519	0	"Oh, okay."
1520	0	"Thank you, sir."
1521	0	I would have gotten bad story in the New York Times.
1522	0	"But I will anyways, so I guess it doesn’t matter."
1523	0	"We’re — we’re kind of, uh —"
1524	0	"Okay, we’ll do you after that."
1525	0	"We’re kind of, uh —"
1526	0	And then we’ll call it quits.
1527	0	"We’re kind of thriving, not failing these days."
1528	0	You’re doing very well.
1529	0	Yeah.
1530	0	"Say, ""Thank you, Mr. Trump"""
1531	0	(LAUGHTER)
1532	0	(Laughs).
1533	0	I think I’ll stop short of that.
1534	0	(LAUGHTER)
1535	0	"I wonder how you do — you know, all my life, I’ve had very few stories — but I’ve had some on the front page of the New York Times."
1536	0	"Now, I think I think I average about three or four a day, right?"
1537	0	That is —
1538	0	"And, of the three or four, they’re all negative."
1539	0	"No matter what I do, they’re negative."
1540	0	But you know what?
1541	0	That’s okay.
1542	0	I still love the paper.
1543	0	Go ahead.
1544	0	(LAUGHTER)
1545	0	"I wanted to come back to China, because I think what you announced today was really important."
1546	0	I agree.
1547	0	"You talk about this friendship you have with Xi Jinping, and yet, essentially, what you did today is accused his government —"
1548	0	That’s right.
1549	0	— of interfering in our internal affairs —
1550	0	That’s right.
1551	0	"— subverting our Democratic process, and doing it to hurt you, the Republican Party —"
1552	0	Doing it to help them.
1553	0	— and your backers.
1554	0	You know what?
1555	0	Yeah.
1556	0	Doing it to help them.
1557	0	So how can a guy who does that be your friend?
1558	0	I think that we are able to — and maybe he’s not anymore.
1559	0	"I’ll be honest with you, I think we had a very good friendship."
1560	0	I think we had a very good relationship; we understand each other.
1561	0	They are doing studies on Donald Trump.
1562	0	They’re trying to figure it all out because this has never happened to them before.
1563	0	It’s never happened.
1564	0	"Think of it, you’ve never seen — you’ve covered very well — you’ve never seen this happen."
1565	0	They’re having big problems.
1566	0	"I don’t want them to have problems, but they got to make a fair deal."
1567	0	Just like Canada has got to make a fair deal.
1568	0	I believe that he and I have a very good chemistry together.
1569	0	And I can tell you that about many leaders.
1570	0	I can also tell you a few where I don’t feel I’ll ever have a chemistry with them.
1571	0	I don’t want to have a chemistry with them.
1572	0	"And for those people, I’ll have Pompeo, Nikki, Bolton, Jared."
1573	0	I can go — our general; I’ll have our general.
1574	0	"Or if they can’t do it, I’ll have Sarah Huckabee do it."
1575	0	Right?
1576	0	"But for the most part, I have very good — very good with Prime Minister Abe."
1577	0	Very good with President Moon.
1578	0	"By the way, what President Moon said last night — I know you won’t report it — but Bret Baier interviewed him last night and he asked him about me."
1579	0	I can’t say — because you would say I’m too braggadocios — but what he said about me last night was an unbelievable thing.
1580	0	"Couldn’t have happened without President Trump, and it never would happen without President Trump. TRUMP And nobody else could do it"
1581	0	"You know, I mean, you’ll take a look."
1582	0	"But I will tell you, China is very special."
1583	0	Very special.
1584	0	They’re incredible people.
1585	0	It’s an incredible country.
1586	0	What they’ve done is unbelievable.
1587	0	How would —
1588	0	And it all started with the WTO.
1589	0	It was a defective deal.
1590	0	"And it all started — without the WTO, China is not China as we know it today."
1591	0	"And then it started also by — our people that are standing right in this position, that are in the Oval Office — another way of saying it — allowed them to get away with murder."
1592	0	Allowed a lot of countries to get away with murder.
1593	0	I think we still probably have a very good relationship.
1594	0	But you know what?
1595	0	"In honor of you, I will, tomorrow, make a call to him."
1596	0	"Say, ""Hey, how you doing?"""
1597	0	Okay?
1598	0	Can I — can I just ask —
1599	0	You don’t mind paying billions of dollars a month in tariffs.
1600	0	I just had two small follow-ups.
1601	0	"One is, how would you compare the level of interference you see today from the Chinese to what Russia did in 2016?"
1602	0	"Well, I think it’s different."
1603	0	"If you look at the Des Moines Register, I mean, they have ads that are made to look like editorials."
1604	1	"Saying about, ""Oh, you got to stop Trump. You got to stop him. You got to vote against him"""
1605	0	My farmers are so incredible.
1606	0	These are patriots.
1607	0	"You know, on a network that doesn’t like me very much — which is most of them — but a network that didn’t — doesn’t really treat me very good, they interviewed farmers."
1608	0	"And they got hurt because, you know, all of a sudden China stops buying."
1609	0	"By the way, they’ve started buying again."
1610	0	I don’t know if you’ve noticed.
1611	0	"And soybeans are going up, and things are going up."
1612	0	And we’ve had very little hurt from what I’ve done.
1613	0	"In fact, the markets have gone up."
1614	0	And the farmers are going to do great.
1615	0	"But, ultimately — but they had farmers, and these guys are amazing; I love them."
1616	0	And they voted for me and they love me.
1617	0	"And they said, ""We don’t care if we get hurt. He’s doing the right thing"""
1618	0	"And, you know, a lot of people — it’s a complex game."
1619	0	A lot of people don’t know exactly what it is.
1620	0	"They don’t know how to define ""tariff"""
1621	0	"They don’t know it is really different than a tax, although it’s getting close."
1622	0	"But they know that for the first time in many, many years, they have a President that’s fighting for them; that’s not letting their jobs be taken to other countries; that’s not allowing the kind of abuse that we — I mean, when you look at what happened, as an example, with NAFTA."
1623	0	And for years — because it was never changed — NAFTA was defective deal the day it was signed.
1624	0	You know why?
1625	1	Because they had a VAT tax of 17 percent and nobody from this country knew that.
1626	0	"And by the time they found out, which was about a week later, nobody went and changed it."
1627	0	So you went many years and they never changed it.
1628	0	There was a VAT tax that Mexico got.
1629	0	"So we were 17 or 16 points behind, before we even started."
1630	0	NAFTA was a horrible thing.
1631	0	"So the farmers and — by the way, the steel workers — you know, I stopped the dumping."
1632	0	The dumping was horrible.
1633	0	"And now if they want to dump, that’s okay, but they’ve got to pay the United States of America 25 percent on everything they dump."
1634	0	That’s okay.
1635	0	"But as I told you before, steel is doing phenomenally well."
1636	0	"But the farmers say, ""This man is fighting for us. No President has ever fought for us before"""
1637	0	And you really have to study what’s happened over the 15 years with the farm.
1638	0	The farmers have been decimated over a 15-year period.
1639	0	They’ve been decimated.
1640	0	The farmers are going to come out great.
1641	0	These are great people.
1642	0	"They’re great, great patriots."
1643	0	I think we should finish with that one.
1644	0	Is that okay?
1645	0	(CROSSTALK)
1646	0	Okay.
1647	0	Go ahead.
1648	0	Let’s go.
1649	0	Fast.
1650	0	Sure.
1651	0	I always like — always like to finish with a good one.
1652	0	"Elton John said, ""When you hit that last tune and it’s good, don’t go back"""
1653	0	(LAUGHTER)
1654	0	I’ve seen — have you ever seen?
1655	0	They do great.
1656	0	They’re great.
1657	0	They hit the last tune and everyone goes crazy.
1658	0	"Then they go back for an encore, right?"
1659	0	And they don’t hit it.
1660	0	And they leave — everyone leaves.
1661	0	"They said, ""That wasn’t a very good concert, was it?"""
1662	0	Let’s go.
1663	0	"Well, I’ll ask you one final question —"
1664	0	You — don’t make me wrong.
1665	0	Go ahead.
1666	0	— ahead of tomorrow’s hearing.
1667	0	Because you were asked earlier in the news conference about Brett —
1668	0	Say it again.
1669	0	Say it again.
1670	0	About the hearing tomorrow.
1671	0	Yes.
1672	0	You were asked earlier in the news conference by my friend from Sky News about the message that you are sending to —
1673	0	Yes.
1674	0	— the women of the country.
1675	0	Right.
1676	0	What about the message that you may be sending to young men?
1677	0	You’re a father.
1678	0	What does this moment that we’re in — the cultural moment —
1679	0	It’s a very big cultural moment.
1680	0	Right.
1681	0	So what messages do you for young men of America?
1682	0	It’s a very big — it’s also — you’re right.
1683	0	I think it’s a great question.
1684	0	"This is a very big moment for our country because you have a man who is very outstanding, but he’s got very strong charges against him — probably charges that nobody is going to be able be — to prove."
1685	0	So I could have you chosen for a position.
1686	0	"I could have you, or you, or you — anybody."
1687	0	And somebody could say things.
1688	0	"And it’s happened to me many times, where false statements are made."
1689	0	"And honestly, nobody knows who to believe."
1690	0	I could pick another Supreme Court judge — Justice.
1691	0	I could pick another one.
1692	0	Another one.
1693	0	Another one.
1694	0	This could go on forever.
1695	0	"Somebody could come and say, ""Thirty years ago, twenty-five years ago, ten years ago, five years ago, he did a horrible thing to me. He did this. He did that. He did that."""
1696	0	"And honestly, it’s a very dangerous period in our country."
1697	0	And it’s being perpetrated by some very evil people.
1698	0	"Some of them are Democrats, I must say."
1699	0	Because some of them know that this is just a game that they’re playing.
1700	0	It’s a con game.
1701	0	It’s at the highest level.
1702	0	We’re talking about the United States Supreme Court.
1703	0	This can go on forever.
1704	0	I can pick five other people.
1705	0	"At a certain point, the people are going to say, ""No, thank you"""

1707	0	And you know what?
1708	0	I would honestly say — because I interviewed great people for this job.
1709	0	"He’s great, but I interviewed other great people for this job."
1710	0	"I could conceivably imagine going to one of them and saying, ""It’s too bad what happened to this wonderful man, but I’m going to choose you, number two. I want you to go"""
1711	0	And I could conceivably be turned down by somebody that desperately wanted this job two months ago.
1712	0	"With respect, sir —"
1713	0	So this is — this is — and this is beyond Supreme Court.
1714	0	Right.
1715	0	There’s nothing beyond Supreme Court; this is beyond Supreme Court.
1716	0	This has everything to do with our country.
1717	0	"When you are guilty until proven innocent, it’s just not supposed to be that way."
1718	0	"Always I heard, ""You’re innocent until proven guilty"""
1719	0	"I’ve heard this for so long, and it’s such a beautiful phrase."
1720	0	"In this case, you’re guilty until proven innocent."

1	1	"Throughout the year, we have seen Democrats across the country uniting around a new legislative proposal that would end Medicare as we know it and take away benefits that seniors have paid for their entire lives."
2	1	"Dishonestly called “Medicare for All,” the Democratic proposal would establish a government-run, single-payer health care system that eliminates all private and employer-based health care plans and would cost an astonishing $32.6 trillion during its first 10 years."
3	1	"As a candidate, I promised that we would protect coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions and create new health care insurance options that would lower premiums."
4	1	"I have kept that promise, and we are now seeing health insurance premiums coming down."
5	1	I also made a solemn promise to our great seniors to protect Medicare.
6	0	That is why I am fighting so hard against the Democrats' plan that would eviscerate Medicare.
7	1	Democrats have already harmed seniors by slashing Medicare by more than $800 billion over 10 years to pay for Obamacare.
8	0	"Likewise, Democrats would gut Medicare with their planned government takeover of American health care."
9	0	The Democrats' plan threatens America's seniors.
10	0	"The Democrats' plan means that after a life of hard work and sacrifice, seniors would no longer be able to depend on the benefits they were promised."
11	1	"By eliminating Medicare as a program for seniors, and outlawing the ability of Americans to enroll in private and employer-based plans, the Democratic plan would inevitably lead to the massive rationing of health care."
12	0	Doctors and hospitals would be put out of business.
13	0	Seniors would lose access to their favorite doctors.
14	0	There would be long wait lines for appointments and procedures.
15	0	Previously covered care would effectively be denied.
16	0	"In practice, the Democratic Party’s so-called Medicare for All would really be Medicare for None."
17	0	"Under the Democrats' plan, today’s Medicare would be forced to die."
18	0	The Democrats' plan also would mean the end of choice for seniors over their own health care decisions.
19	0	"Instead, Democrats would give total power and control over seniors’ health care decisions to the bureaucrats in Washington, D.C."
20	0	"My family escaped socialism, now my fellow Democrats think we should move the party in its direction."
21	0	The first thing the Democratic plan will do to end choice for seniors is eliminate Medicare Advantage plans for about 20 million seniors as well as eliminate other private health plans that seniors currently use to supplement their Medicare coverage.
22	0	"Next, the Democrats would eliminate every American’s private and employer-based health plan."
23	0	It is right there in their proposed legislation: Democrats outlaw private health plans that offer the same benefits as the government plan.
24	0	"Americans might think that such an extreme, anti-senior, anti-choice and anti-consumer proposal for government-run health care would find little support among Democrats in Congress."
25	1	"Unfortunately, they would be wrong: 123 Democrats in the House of Representatives — 64 percent of House Democrats — as well as 15 Democrats in the Senate have already formally co-sponsored this legislation."
26	0	"Democratic nominees for governor in Florida, California and Maryland are all campaigning in support of it, as are many Democratic congressional candidates."
27	1	Democrats want open-borders socialism.
28	0	The truth is that the centrist Democratic Party is dead.
29	0	The new Democrats are radical socialists who want to model America’s economy after Venezuela.
30	0	"If Democrats win control of Congress this November, we will come dangerously closer to socialism in America."
31	0	Government-run health care is just the beginning.
32	0	"Democrats are also pushing massive government control of education, private-sector businesses and other major sectors of the U.S. economy."
33	0	Every single citizen will be harmed by such a radical shift in American culture and life.
34	0	"Virtually everywhere it has been tried, socialism has brought suffering, misery and decay."
35	1	"Indeed, the Democrats' commitment to government-run health care is all the more menacing to our seniors and our economy when paired with some Democrats' absolute commitment to end enforcement of our immigration laws by abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement."
36	0	That means millions more would cross our borders illegally and take advantage of health care paid for by American taxpayers.
37	1	Today’s Democratic Party is for open-borders socialism.
38	0	This radical agenda would destroy American prosperity.
39	0	"Under its vision, costs will spiral out of control."
40	0	Taxes will skyrocket.
41	0	"And Democrats will seek to slash budgets for seniors’ Medicare, Social Security and defense."
42	0	Republicans believe that a Medicare program that was created for seniors and paid for by seniors their entire lives should always be protected and preserved.
43	0	I am committed to resolutely defending Medicare and Social Security from the radical socialist plans of the Democrats.
44	0	"For the sake of our country, our prosperity, our seniors and all Americans — this is a fight we must win."
1	0	"Okay, thank you very much."
2	0	It's a great honor to have Nancy Pelosi with us and Chuck Schumer with us.
3	0	And we've actually worked very hard on a couple of things that are happening.
4	0	"Criminal justice reform — as you know, we've just heard word — got word that Mitch McConnell and the group, we're going to be putting it up for a vote."
5	0	"We have great Democrat support, great Republican support."
6	0	"So, criminal justice reform, something that people have been trying to get — how long, Nancy?"
7	0	Many years.
8	0	A long time.
9	0	"Many, many years."
10	0	"Looks like it's going to be passing, hopefully — famous last words — on a very bipartisan way."
11	0	And it's really something we're all very proud of.
12	0	"And again, tremendous support from Republicans and tremendous support from Democrats."
13	0	And I think it's going to get a very good vote.
14	0	And we'll see soon enough.
15	0	But it will be up for a vote very shortly.
16	0	A lot of years they've been waiting for it.
17	0	"The other thing, the farm bill is moving along nicely."
18	0	And I guess they'll be voting on Friday or so.
19	0	But pretty close.
20	0	Soon.
21	0	Soon.
22	0	(Inaudible.)
23	0	And we think the farm bill is in very good shape.
24	0	"A lot of good things are happening with it, and our farmers are well taken care of."
25	0	"And again, that will be quite bipartisan and it will happen pretty soon."
26	0	"And then we have the easy one, the wall."
27	0	That will be the one that will be the easiest of all.
28	0	"What do you think, Chuck?"
29	0	Maybe not?
30	0	"It's called ""funding the government,"" Mr. President."
31	0	(LAUGHTER)
32	0	So we're going to see.
33	0	"But I will tell you, the wall will get built."
34	0	We'll see what happens.
35	0	"It is not an easy situation because the Democrats have a different view, I think, than — I can say — the Republicans."
36	0	We have great Republican support.
37	0	We don't have Democrat support.
38	0	But we're going to talk about that now.
39	0	We're going to see.
40	0	One thing that I do have to say is:
41	0	"Tremendous amounts of wall have already been built, and a lot of — a lot of wall."
42	0	"When you include the renovation of existing fences and walls, we've renovated a tremendous amount and we've done a lot of work."
43	0	"In San Diego, we're building new walls right now."
44	0	"And we've — right next to San Diego, we've completed a major section of wall and it's really worked well."
45	0	"So, a lot of wall has been built."
46	0	"We don't talk about that, but we might as well start, because it's building — it's being built right now, big sections of wall."
47	0	And we will continue that.
48	0	"And one way or the other, it's going to get built."
49	0	"I'd like not to see a government closing, a shutdown."
50	0	We will see what happens over the next short period of time.
51	0	But the wall is a very important thing to us.
52	0	I might put it a different way.
53	0	"Border security is extremely important, and we have to take care of border security."
54	0	"When you look at what happened with the caravans, with the people, with a lot of — we shut it down; we had no choice."
55	0	We shut it down.
56	0	But it could be a lot easier if we had real border security.
57	0	I just want to pay my respects to the Border Patrol agents and officers.
58	0	They've been incredible.
59	0	"The ICE agents and officers, they've been incredible."
60	0	"And very importantly, our military."
61	0	Our military went in and they did an incredible job.
62	0	"They have been really, really spectacular."
63	0	"A lot of the people that wanted to come into the country, and really, they were to come in no matter how they wanted to come in — they were going to come in even in a rough way — many of these people are leaving now and they're going back to their countries: Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and other countries."
64	0	They're leaving.
65	0	"If you noticed, it's getting a lot less crowded in Mexico."
66	0	"And a lot of them are going to stay in Mexico, and the Mexican government has been working with us very well."
67	0	So we appreciate that.
68	0	But they haven't been coming into our country.
69	0	We can't let people come in that way.
70	0	So that's pretty much it.
71	0	We're going to talk about the wall.
72	0	"I wanted to talk about criminal justice reform, just to let you know how positive that is."
73	0	"I want to talk about the farm bill, how positive that is."
74	0	And I want to talk about the wall.
75	0	"And I will tell you, it's a tough issue because we are in very opposite sides of — I really think I can say ""border security,"" but certainly the wall."
76	0	But the wall will get built.
77	1	A lot of the wall is built.
78	1	It's been very effective.
79	0	I asked for a couple of notes on that.
80	1	"If you look at San Diego, illegal traffic dropped 92 percent once the wall was up."
81	1	"El Paso, illegal traffic dropped 72 percent, then ultimately 95 percent, once the wall was up."
82	1	"In Tucson, Arizona, illegal traffic dropped 92 percent."
83	1	"Yuma, it dropped illegal traffic 95 to 96 percent."
84	0	"I mean — and when I say ""dropped,"" the only reason we even have any percentage where people got through is because they walk and go around areas that aren't built."
85	1	It dropped virtually 100 percent in the areas where the wall is.
86	1	"So, I mean, it's very effective."
87	0	"If you really want to find out how effective a wall is, just ask Israel — 99.9 percent effective."
88	0	"And our wall will be every bit as good as that, if not better."
89	0	So we've done a lot of work on the wall; a lot of wall is built.
90	0	A lot of people don't know that.
91	0	A lot of wall is renovated.
92	0	We have walls that were in very bad condition that are now in A1 tip-top shape.
93	0	"And, frankly, some wall has been reinforced by our military."
94	0	Our military has done a fantastic job.
95	0	"So the wall will get built, but we may not — we may not have an agreement today."
96	0	We probably won't.
97	0	But we have an agreement on other things that are really good.
98	0	"Nancy, would you like to say something?"
99	0	"Well, thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to meet with you so that we can work together in a bipartisan way to meet the needs of the American people."
100	0	"I think the American people recognize that we must keep government open, that a shutdown is not worth anything, and that you should not have a Trump shutdown."
101	0	You have the White House —
102	0	"Did you say ""Trump"" — oh, oh."
103	0	"A ""Trump shutdown."""
104	0	You have the White House —
105	0	"I was going to call it a ""Pelosi shutdown."""
106	0	You have the Senate.
107	0	You have the House of Representatives.
108	0	You have the votes.
109	0	You should pass it right now.
110	0	"No, we don't have the votes, Nancy, because in the Senate, we need 60 votes and we don't have it."
111	0	"No, no, but in the House, you could bring it up right now, today."
112	0	"Yeah, but I can't — excuse me."
113	0	But I can't get it passed in the House if it's not going to pass in the Senate.
114	0	I don't want to waste time.
115	0	"Well, the fact is you can get it started that way."
116	0	"The House we can get passed very easily, and we do."
117	0	"Okay, then do it."
118	0	Then do it.
119	0	"But the problem is the Senate, because we need 10 Democrats to vote, and they won't vote."
120	0	"No, no, that's not the point, Mr. President."
121	0	The point is —
122	0	It's sort of the point.
123	0	— that there are equities to be weighed.
124	0	And we are here to have a conversation —
125	0	Correct.
126	0	— in a careful way.
127	0	So I don't think we should have a debate in front of the press on this.
128	0	"But the fact is, the House Republicans could bring up this bill, if they had the votes, immediately, and set the tone for what you want."
129	0	"If we thought we were going to get it passed in the Senate, Nancy, we would do it immediately."
130	0	We would get it passed very easily in the House.
131	0	"No, that's not the point."
132	0	That's not the point.
133	0	"Nancy, I'd have it passed in two seconds."
134	0	"It doesn't matter, though, because we can't get it passed in the Senate because we need 10 Democrat votes."
135	0	That's the problem.
136	0	"Well, again, let us have our conversation —"
137	0	That's right.
138	0	— and then we can meet with the press again.
139	0	"But the fact is, is that legislating — which is what we do —"
140	0	Right.
141	0	"— you begin, you make your point, you state your case."
142	0	"That's what the House Republicans could do, if they had the votes."
143	0	"But there are no votes in the House, a majority of votes, for a wall — no matter where you start."
144	0	That is exactly right.
145	0	You don't have the votes in the House.
146	0	"If I needed the votes for the wall in the House, I would have them — in one session, it would be done."
147	0	"Well, then go do it."
148	0	Go do it.
149	0	It doesn't help because we need 10 Democrats in the Senate.
150	0	"No, don't put it on the Senate."
151	0	Put it on the negotiation.
152	0	"Okay, let me ask you this."
153	0	Just — and we're doing this in a very friendly manner.
154	0	"It doesn't help for me to take a vote in the House, where I will win easily with the Republicans —"
155	0	You will not win.
156	0	It doesn't help to take that vote because I'm not going to get the vote of the Senate.
157	0	"Well, don't blame it on the Senate, Mr. President."
158	0	I need 10 senators.
159	0	That's the problem.
160	0	"Mr. President, you have the White House, you have the Senate."
161	0	I have the White House.
162	0	You have the House of Representatives.
163	0	The White House is done.
164	0	And the House would give me the vote if I wanted it.
165	0	But I can't because I need —
166	0	But you can't — you can't —
167	0	"Nancy, I need 10 votes from Chuck."
168	0	"All right, let me say something here."
169	0	"Mr. President, let me — let me just say one thing."
170	0	The fact is you do not have the votes in the House.
171	0	"Nancy, I do."
172	0	And we need border security.
173	0	"Well, let's take the vote and we'll find out."
174	0	Nancy.
175	0	Nancy.
176	0	We need border security.
177	0	It's very simple.
178	0	Of course we do.
179	0	We need border security.
180	0	We do.
181	1	"People are pouring into our country, including terrorists."
182	0	We have terrorists.
183	1	We caught 10 terrorists over the last very short period of time.
184	0	Ten.
185	0	These are very serious people.
186	0	"Our border agents, all of our law enforcement has been incredible what they've done."
187	1	But we caught 10 terrorists.
188	0	These are people that were looking to do harm.
189	0	We need the wall.
190	0	"We need — more important than anything, we need border security, of which the wall is just a piece."
191	0	But it's important.
192	0	"Chuck, did you want to say something?"
193	0	Yeah.
194	0	Here's what I want to say:
195	0	We have a lot of disagreements here.
196	0	The Washington Post today gave you a whole lot of Pinocchios because they say you constantly misstate how much the wall is — how much of the wall is built and how much is there.
197	0	But that's not the point here.
198	0	We have a disagreement about the wall —
199	0	"Well, the Washington Post —"
200	0	(LAUGHTER)
201	0	— whether it's effective or it isn't.
202	0	"Not on border security, but on the wall."
203	0	We do not want to shut down the government.
204	0	You have called 20 times to shut down the government.
205	0	"You say, ""I want to shut down the government."""
206	0	We don't.
207	0	We want to come to an agreement.
208	0	"If we can't come to an agreement, we have solutions that will pass the House and Senate right now, and will not shut down the government."
209	0	And that's what we're urging you to do.
210	0	Not threaten to shut down the government —
211	0	Chuck —
212	0	— because you —
213	0	"You don't want to shut down the government, Chuck."
214	0	Let me just finish.
215	0	Because you can't get your way.
216	0	Because the last time you shut it down you got killed.
217	0	Yeah.
218	0	"Let me say something, Mr. President."
219	0	"You just say, ""My way, or we'll shut down the government."""
220	0	We have a proposal that Democrats and Republicans will support to do a CR that will not shut down the government.
221	0	We urge you to take it.
222	0	"And if it's not good border security, I won't take it."
223	0	It is good border security.
224	0	It is very good border security.
225	0	"And if it's not good border security, I won't take it."
226	0	It's actually what the border security asked for.
227	0	It's what the border —
228	0	"Because when you look at these numbers of the effectiveness of our border security, and when you look at the job that we're doing with our military —"
229	0	You just said it is effective.
230	0	Can I be — can I tell you something?
231	0	"Yeah, you just said it's effective."
232	0	Without a wall — these are only areas where you have the walls.
233	0	We want to do this —
234	0	"Where you have walls, Chuck, it's effective."
235	0	"Where you don't have walls, it is not effective."
236	0	Wait a second.
237	0	Let's call a halt to this.
238	0	Yeah.
239	0	Let's call a halt to this.
240	0	"We've come in here as the first branch of government: Article I, the legislative branch."
241	0	"We're coming in, in good faith, to negotiate with you about how we can keep the government open."
242	0	Open.
243	0	We're going to keep it open —
244	0	The American —
245	0	— if we have border security.
246	0	The American —
247	0	"If we don't have border security, Chuck —"
248	0	I'm with you.
249	0	— we're not going to keep it open.
250	0	I'm with you.
251	0	We are going to have border security.
252	0	And it's the same border –
253	0	Effective border security.
254	0	You're bragging about what has been done.
255	0	By us.
256	0	"We want to do the same thing we did last year, this year."
257	0	That's our proposal.
258	0	"If it's good then, it's good now, and it won't shut down the government."
259	0	"Chuck, we can build a much bigger section with more money."
260	0	Let's debate —
261	0	We have taken —
262	0	Let's debate in private.
263	0	We have taken this conversation —
264	0	Okay?
265	0	Okay.
266	0	Yeah.
267	0	"— to a place that is devoid, frankly, of fact."
268	0	And we can dispel that.
269	0	We need border security.
270	0	And I think we all agree that we need border security.
271	0	"Yes, we do."
272	0	Is that right?
273	0	We do.
274	0	See?
275	0	We get along.
276	0	"Thank you, everybody."
277	0	(Inaudible)
278	0	Mr. President.
279	0	You say border security and the wall.
280	0	Can you have border security without the wall?
281	0	There's a commonality on border security.
282	0	"No, you need the wall."
283	0	The wall is a part of border security.
284	0	Are you re-defining what it means to have border security?
285	0	Yes.
286	0	Yeah.
287	0	We need border security.
288	0	The wall is a part of border security.
289	0	"You can't have very good border security without the wall, no."
290	0	That's simply not true.
291	0	That is a political promise.
292	0	Border security is a way to effectively honor our responsibilities.
293	0	"And the experts say you can do border security without a wall, which is wasteful and doesn't solve the problem."
294	0	It totally solves the problem.
295	0	"Again, but I don't want to take this —"
296	0	And it's very important.
297	0	"Unfortunately, this has spiraled downward from — we came at a place to say, ""How do we meet the needs of American people who have needs?"""
298	1	The economy has — people are losing their jobs.
299	0	The market is in a mood.
300	0	Our members are already (inaudible).
301	1	"Well, we have the lowest unemployment that we've had in 50 years."
302	0	Sixty people of the Republican Party have lost — are losing their offices now because of the transition.
303	0	People are not — the morale is not —
304	0	And we've gained in the Senate.
305	0	"Nancy, we've gained in the Senate."
306	0	The morale —
307	0	Excuse me.
308	0	Did we win the Senate?
309	0	— is not (inaudible).
310	0	We won the Senate.
311	0	"When the President brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana, he's in real trouble."
312	0	I did.
313	0	Let me say this.
314	0	We did win North Dakota.
315	0	This is the most unfortunate thing.
316	0	"We came in here in good faith, and we are entering into this kind of a discussion in the public view."
317	0	"But it's not bad, Nancy."
318	0	"Let us — no, but it's —"
319	0	It's called transparency.
320	0	I know.
321	0	But it's not transparency when we're not stipulating to a set of facts.
322	0	And when we wanted to have a debate with you about saying we'd confront some of these facts  —
323	0	You know what?
324	0	We need border security.
325	0	"— without saying to the public, ""This isn't true."""
326	0	That's what we're going to be talking about: border security.
327	0	"If we don't have border security, we'll shut down the government."
328	0	This country needs border security.
329	0	We agree with that.
330	0	The wall is a part of border security.
331	0	(Inaudible.)
332	0	Let's have a talk.
333	0	We're going to get the wall built and we've done a lot of wall already.
334	0	"Mr. President, how big a part of border security is the wall?"
335	0	Is that the —
336	0	It's a big section.
337	0	It's a big part of it.
338	0	Is it everything that you need?
339	0	It's a big part of it.
340	0	We need to have effective border security.
341	0	"We need a wall in certain parts — no, not in all parts — but in certain parts of a 2,000-mile border, we need a wall."
342	0	"How much money, Mr. President?"
343	0	We are doing it much under budget.
344	0	We're actually way under —
345	0	(Inaudible) this conversation.
346	0	— budget on the areas that we've renovated and areas that we've built.
347	0	I would say if we got —
348	0	Do you still need the —
349	0	"— if we got $5 billion, we could do a tremendous chunk of wall."
350	0	Is that mandatory?
351	0	Would you accept less though?
352	0	And are your guests conversely willing to offer more?
353	0	"Well, we're going to see."
354	0	We're going to see.
355	0	"Look, we have to have the wall."
356	0	This isn't a question; this is a national emergency.
357	0	Drugs are pouring into our country.
358	1	"People with tremendous medical difficulty and medical problems are pouring in, and in many — in many cases, it's contagious."
359	0	They're pouring into our country.
360	0	We have to have border security.
361	0	We have to have a wall as part of border security.
362	0	And I don't think we really disagree so much.
363	0	"I also know that, you know, Nancy is in a situation where it's not easy for her to talk right now, and I understand that."
364	0	And I fully understand that.
365	0	We're going to have a good discussion and we're going to see what happens.
366	0	Mr. President —
367	0	But we have to have border security.
368	0	"Mr. President, please don't characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the Leader of the House Democrats who just won a big victory."
369	0	But let me —
370	0	"Elections have consequences, Mr. President."
371	0	Let me just say —
372	0	That's right.
373	0	And that's why the country is doing so well.
374	0	Let me say this:
375	0	What the President is representing in terms of his cards over there are not factual.
376	0	"We have to have to an evidence-based conversation about what does work, what money has been spent, and how effective it is."
377	0	This isn't about — this is about the security of our country.
378	0	"We take an oath to protect and defend, and we don't want to have that mischaracterized by anyone."
379	0	And we are —
380	0	I agree with that.
381	0	— that we are —
382	0	"No, no I agree with that."
383	0	— we are (inaudible).
384	0	"So let us have a conversation where we don't have to contradict, in public, the statistics that you put forth but instead can have a conversation about what would really work and what the American people deserve from us at this uncertain time in their lives, where they have apprehension."
385	0	The one thing I think we can agree on is we shouldn't shut down the government over a dispute.
386	0	And you want to shut it down.
387	0	You keep talking about it.
388	0	"I — no, no, no, no, no."
389	1	"The last time, Chuck, you shut it down —"
390	0	"No, no, no."
391	0	— and then you opened it up very quickly.
392	0	Twenty times.
393	0	Twenty times.
394	0	And I don't want to do what you did.
395	0	"But, Chuck —"
396	0	"Twenty times you have called for, ""I will shut down the government if I don't get my wall."""
397	0	None of us have said —
398	0	You want to know something?
399	0	You've said it.
400	0	"Okay, you want to put that on my —"
401	0	You said it.
402	0	I'll take it.
403	0	"Okay, good."
404	0	"You know what I'll say: Yes, if we don't get what we want, one way or the other — whether it's through you, through a military, through anything you want to call — I will shut down the government."
405	0	Absolutely.
406	0	Okay.
407	0	Fair enough.
408	0	We disagree.
409	0	And I am proud — and I'll tell you what —
410	0	We disagree.
411	0	"I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck, because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country."
412	0	So I will take the mantle.
413	0	I will be the one to shut it down.
414	0	I'm not going to blame you for it.
415	0	"The last time you shut it down, it didn't work."
416	0	I will take the mantle of shutting down.
417	0	That is (inaudible).
418	0	And I'm going to shut it down for border security.
419	0	But we believe you shouldn't shut it down.
420	0	Okay.
421	0	Thank you very much everybody.
422	0	Thank you.
423	0	(Inaudible) shut down the government.
424	0	Chief of Staff?
425	0	"Have you picked a Chief of Staff, Mr. President?"
426	0	Thank you very much.
427	0	"Yeah, we're interviewing a lot of — we have a lot of great people for Chief of Staff."
428	0	A lot of people want the job.
429	0	A lot of people want the job.
430	0	And I have some great people.
431	0	A lot of friends of mine want it.
432	0	A lot of people that Chuck and Nancy know very well want it.
433	0	I think people you'd like.
434	0	We have a lot of people that want the job — Chief of Staff.
435	0	So we'll be seeing what happens very soon.
436	0	We're in no rush.
437	0	We're in no rush.
438	0	Why?
439	0	"Why no rush, Mr. President?"
440	0	Why?
441	0	Because we have a wonderful Chief of Staff right now.
442	0	Just no — we are in no rush.
443	0	"Over a period of a week or two, or maybe less, we'll announce who it's going to be."
444	0	But we have a lot of people that want the position.
445	0	Thank you very much everybody.
446	0	Thanks.
1	0	"Thank you, Klaus, very much."
2	0	"It’s a privilege to be here at this forum where leaders in business, science, art, diplomacy, and world affairs have gathered for many, many years to discuss how we can advance prosperity, security, and peace."
3	0	I’m here today to represent the interests of the American people and to affirm America’s friendship and partnership in building a better world.
4	0	"Like all nations represented at this great forum, America hopes for a future in which everyone can prosper, and every child can grow up free from violence, poverty, and fear."
5	0	"Over the past year, we have made extraordinary strides in the U.S."
6	0	"We’re lifting up forgotten communities, creating exciting new opportunities, and helping every American find their path to the American Dream — the dream of a great job, a safe home, and a better life for their children."
7	0	"After years of stagnation, the United States is once again experiencing strong economic growth."
8	0	"The stock market is smashing one record after another, and has added more than $7 trillion in new wealth since my election."
9	1	"Consumer confidence, business confidence, and manufacturing confidence are the highest they have been in many decades."
10	1	"Since my election, we’ve created 2.4 million jobs, and that number is going up very, very substantially."
11	0	Small-business optimism is at an all-time high.
12	1	New unemployment claims are near the lowest we’ve seen in almost half a century.
13	1	"African American unemployment has reached the lowest rate ever recorded in the United States, and so has unemployment among Hispanic Americans."
14	0	The world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and prosperous America.
15	0	I’m here to deliver a simple message:
16	0	"There has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest, and to grow in the United States."
17	0	"America is open for business, and we are competitive once again."
18	0	"The American economy is by far the largest in the world, and we’ve just enacted the most significant tax cuts and reform in American history."
19	0	We’ve massively cut taxes for the middle class and small businesses to let working families keep more of their hard-earned money.
20	0	"We lowered our corporate tax rate from 35 percent, all the way down to 21 percent."
21	0	"As a result, millions of workers have received tax cut bonuses from their employers in amounts as large as $3,000."
22	1	"The tax cut bill is expected to raise the average American’s household income by more than $4,000."
23	0	"The world’s largest company, Apple, announced plans to bring $245 billion in overseas profits home to America."
24	0	Their total investment into the United States economy will be more than $350 billion over the next five years.
25	0	"Now is the perfect time to bring your business, your jobs, and your investments to the United States."
26	1	This is especially true because we have undertaken the most extensive regulatory reduction ever conceived.
27	0	Regulation is stealth taxation.
28	0	"The U.S., like many other countries, unelected bureaucrats — and we have — believe me, we have them all over the place — and they’ve imposed crushing and anti-business and anti-worker regulations on our citizens with no vote, no legislative debate, and no real accountability."
29	0	"In America, those days are over."
30	0	I pledged to eliminate two unnecessary regulations for every one new regulation.
31	0	We have succeeded beyond our highest expectations.
32	0	"Instead of 2 for 1, we have cut 22 burdensome regulations for every 1 new rule."
33	0	We are freeing our businesses and workers so they can thrive and flourish as never before.
34	0	"We are creating an environment that attracts capital, invites investment, and rewards production."
35	0	America is the place to do business.
36	0	"So come to America, where you can innovate, create, and build."
37	0	I believe in America.
38	0	"As President of the United States, I will always put America first, just like the leaders of other countries should put their country first also."
39	0	But America first does not mean America alone.
40	0	"When the United States grows, so does the world."
41	0	"American prosperity has created countless jobs all around the globe, and the drive for excellence, creativity, and innovation in the U.S. has led to important discoveries that help people everywhere live more prosperous and far healthier lives."
42	0	"As the United States pursues domestic reforms to unleash jobs and growth, we are also working to reform the international trading system so that it promotes broadly shared prosperity and rewards to those who play by the rules."
43	0	We cannot have free and open trade if some countries exploit the system at the expense of others.
44	0	"We support free trade, but it needs to be fair and it needs to be reciprocal."
45	0	"Because, in the end, unfair trade undermines us all."
46	0	"The United States will no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices, including massive intellectual property theft, industrial subsidies, and pervasive state-led economic planning."
47	0	"These and other predatory behaviors are distorting the global markets and harming businesses and workers, not just in the U.S., but around the globe."
48	0	"Just like we expect the leaders of other countries to protect their interests, as President of the United States, I will always protect the interests of our country, our companies, and our workers."
49	0	We will enforce our trade laws and restore integrity to our trading system.
50	0	Only by insisting on fair and reciprocal trade can we create a system that works not just for the U.S. but for all nations.
51	0	"As I have said, the United States is prepared to negotiate mutually beneficial, bilateral trade agreements with all countries."
52	0	"This will include the countries in TPP, which are very important."
53	0	We have agreements with several of them already.
54	0	"We would consider negotiating with the rest, either individually, or perhaps as a group, if it is in the interests of all."
55	0	My administration is also taking swift action in other ways to restore American confidence and independence.
56	0	"We are lifting self-imposed restrictions on energy production to provide affordable power to our citizens and businesses, and to promote energy security for our friends all around the world."
57	0	No country should be held hostage to a single provider of energy.
58	0	"America is roaring back, and now is the time to invest in the future of America."
59	0	We have dramatically cut taxes to make America competitive.
60	0	We are eliminating burdensome regulations at a record pace.
61	0	"We are reforming the bureaucracy to make it lean, responsive, and accountable."
62	0	And we are ensuring our laws are enforced fairly.
63	0	"We have the best colleges and universities in the world, and we have the best workers in the world."
64	0	Energy is abundant and affordable.
65	0	There has never been a better time to come to America.
66	0	We are also making historic investments in the American military because we cannot have prosperity without security.
67	0	"To make the world safer from rogue regimes, terrorism, and revisionist powers, we are asking our friends and allies to invest in their own defenses and to meet their financial obligations."
68	0	Our common security requires everyone to contribute their fair share.
69	0	"My administration is proud to have led historic efforts, at the United Nations Security Council and all around the world, to unite all civilized nations in our campaign of maximum pressure to de-nuke the Korean Peninsula."
70	0	We continue to call on partners to confront Iran’s support for terrorists and block Iran’s path to a nuclear weapon.
71	0	"We’re also working with allies and partners to destroy jihadist terrorist organizations such as ISIS, and very successfully so."
72	0	"The United States is leading a very broad coalition to deny terrorists control of their territory and populations, to cut off their funding, and to discredit their wicked ideology."
73	1	I am pleased to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has retaken almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria.
74	0	There is still more fighting and work to be done and to consolidate our gains.
75	0	We are committed to ensuring that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for terrorists who want to commit mass murder to our civilian populations.
76	0	I want to thank those nations represented here today that have joined in these crucial efforts.
77	0	"You are not just securing your own citizens, but saving lives and restoring hope for millions and millions of people."
78	0	"When it comes to terrorism, we will do whatever is necessary to protect our nation."
79	0	We will defend our citizens and our borders.
80	0	"We are also securing our immigration system, as a matter of both national and economic security."
81	0	"America is a cutting-edge economy, but our immigration system is stuck in the past."
82	0	"We must replace our current system of extended-family chain migration with a merit-based system of admissions that selects new arrivals based on their ability to contribute to our economy, to support themselves financially, and to strengthen our country."
83	0	"In rebuilding America, we are also fully committed to developing our workforce."
84	0	"We are lifting people from dependence to independence, because we know the single best anti-poverty program is a very simple and very beautiful paycheck."
85	0	"To be successful, it is not enough to invest in our economy."
86	0	We must invest in our people.
87	0	"When people are forgotten, the world becomes fractured."
88	0	Only by hearing and responding to the voices of the forgotten can we create a bright future that is truly shared by all.
89	0	The nation’s greatness is more than the sum of its production.
90	0	"A nation’s greatness is the sum of its citizens: the values, pride, love, devotion, and character of the people who call that nation home."
91	0	"From my first international G7 Summit, to the G20, to the U.N. General Assembly, to APEC, to the World Trade Organization, and today at the World Economic Forum, my administration has not only been present, but has driven our message that we are all stronger when free, sovereign nations cooperate toward shared goals and they cooperate toward shared dreams."
92	0	Represented in this room are some of the remarkable citizens from all over the world.
93	0	"You are national leaders, business titans, industry giants, and many of the brightest minds in many fields."
94	0	"Each of you has the power to change hearts, transform lives, and shape your countries’ destinies."
95	0	"With this power comes an obligation, however — a duty of loyalty to the people, workers, and customers who have made you who you are."
96	0	"So together, let us resolve to use our power, our resources, and our voices, not just for ourselves, but for our people — to lift their burdens, to raise their hopes, and to empower their dreams; to protect their families, their communities, their histories, and their futures."
97	0	"That’s what we’re doing in America, and the results are totally unmistakable."
98	0	It’s why new businesses and investment are flooding in.
99	0	It’s why our unemployment rate is the lowest it’s been in so many decades.
100	0	It’s why America’s future has never been brighter.
101	0	"Today, I am inviting all of you to become part of this incredible future we are building together."
102	0	"Thank you to our hosts, thank you to the leaders and innovators in the audience."
103	0	"But most importantly, thank you to all of the hardworking men and women who do their duty each and every day, making this a better world for everyone."
104	0	"Together, let us send our love and our gratitude to make them, because they really make our countries run."
105	0	They make our countries great.
106	0	"Thank you, and God bless you all."
107	0	Thank you very much.
108	0	(APPLAUSE)
109	0	Thank you very much.
110	0	"Thank you, Mr. President, for this inspiring speech."
111	0	"As it is tradition at the forum, I will ask you one or two questions."
112	0	"And my first question is, why is the tax reform — why has it been of such a high priority for your administration?"
113	0	"Well, first of all, Klaus, I want to congratulate you."
114	0	This is an incredible group of people.
115	0	"We had dinner last night with about 15 leaders of industry, none of whom I knew, but all of whom I’ve read about for years."
116	0	And it was truly an incredible group.
117	0	But I think I have 15 new friends.
118	0	"So this has been really great what you’ve done and putting it together, the economic forum."
119	0	"The tax reform was a dream of a lot of people over many years, but they weren’t able to get it done."
120	0	"Many people tried, and Ronald Reagan was really the last to make a meaningful cut and reform."
121	0	And ours is cutting and reforming.
122	0	"We emphasize cut, but the reform is probably almost as important."
123	0	We’ve wanted to do it.
124	0	"It is very tough, politically, to do it."
125	0	"Hard to believe that would be, but it is very, very tough."
126	0	That’s why it hasn’t been done in close to 40 years.
127	0	"And once we got it going, it was going."
128	0	"And the big — and I wouldn’t say a total surprise, but one of the big things that happened and took place is AT&T and some others came out very early and they said they were going to pay thousands and thousands of dollars to people that work for their companies."
129	0	"And you have 300,000, 400,000, 500,000 people working for these companies, and all of a sudden it became like a big waterfall, a big, beautiful waterfall where so many companies are doing it."
130	0	And even today they just announced many more.
131	0	But every day they announce more and more.
132	0	And now it’s a fight for who’s going to give the most.
133	0	"It started at 1,000, and now we have them up to 3,000."
134	0	This is something that we didn’t anticipate.
135	0	"Oftentimes in business, things happen that you don’t anticipate."
136	0	"Usually that’s a bad thing, but this was a good thing."
137	0	This came out of nowhere.
138	0	Nobody ever thought of this as a possibility even.
139	0	It wasn’t in the equation.
140	0	"We waited — we said, wait until February 1st when the checks start coming in."
141	0	"And people, Klaus, have a lot more money in their paycheck — because it’s not just a little money, this is a lot of money for people making a living doing whatever they may be doing."
142	0	"And we really though February 1st it was going to kick in and everybody was going to be — well, we haven’t even gotten there yet and it’s kicked in."
143	0	And it’s had an incredible impact on the stock market and the stock prices.
144	0	"We’ve set 84 records since my election — record stock market prices, meaning we hit new highs 84 different times out of a one-year period."
145	0	And that’s a great thing.
146	0	"And in all fairness, that was done before we passed the tax cuts and tax reform."
147	0	So what happened is really something special.
148	0	"Then, as you know, and as I just said, Apple came in with $350 billion."
149	0	"And I tell you, I spoke with Tim Cook; I said, Tim, I will never consider this whole great run that we’ve made complete until you start building plants in the U.S."
150	0	"And I will tell you, this moved up very substantially."
151	0	"But when I heard 350, I thought he was talking — I thought they were talking $350 million."
152	0	"And, by the way, that’s a nice-sized plant."
153	0	"Not the greatest, but not bad."
154	0	"And they said, “No, sir. It’s $350 billion.”"
155	0	"I said, that is something."
156	0	"Well, we have tremendous amounts of money, including my newfound friends from last night — great companies."
157	0	They’re all investing.
158	0	"When one of the gentlemen said he’s putting in $2 billion because of the tax cuts, I said to myself, “Wow, he’s actually the cheap one in the group” — because they’re putting in massive numbers of billions of dollars."
159	0	So I think you have a brand-new United States.
160	0	"You have a United States where people from all over the world are looking to come in and invest, and there’s just nothing like what’s happening."
161	0	"And I just want to finish by — I have a group of people that have been so — I have a whole lot of them, so I won’t introduce because then I’ll insult at least half of them."
162	0	But I’ve had a group of people that worked so hard on this and other things.
163	0	And we’re really doing — we had a great first year — so successful in so many different ways.
164	0	And there’s a tremendous spirit.
165	1	"When you look at all of the different charts and polls, and you see, as an example, African American unemployment at the historic low — it’s never had a period of time like this."
166	1	Same with Hispanic.
167	1	Women at a 17-year low.
168	0	It’s very heartwarming to see.
169	0	But there’s a tremendous spirit in the United States.
170	0	I would say it’s a spirit like I have never witnessed before.
171	0	I’ve been here for awhile.
172	0	I have never witnessed the spirit that our country has right now.
173	0	"So I just want to thank you all, and all those that are pouring billions of dollars into our country, or ten dollars into our country, we thank you very much."
174	0	Thank you.
175	0	"Mr. President, I will ask you, maybe, a personal question."
176	0	"But before doing so, I’d just like to —"
177	0	Sounds very interesting.
178	0	I didn’t know about this one.
179	0	I would like to acknowledge the strong presence of your Cabinet members
180	0	Yes.
181	0	— who tremendously contributed to the discussions the last (inaudible).
182	0	"Good, I would like to do that."
183	0	That’s very nice.
184	0	Yeah.
185	0	Now —
186	0	"Steven, Wilbur, Gary, Robert, even my General and my various other generals, you know."
187	0	We’re making our military protection a little bit better for us too.
188	0	So thank you very much.
189	0	Does everybody understand that?
190	0	I think so.
191	0	Thank you all for being here.
192	0	"Now my, maybe personal, question would be: What experience from your past have been most useful in preparing you for the Presidency?"
193	0	"Well, being a businessman has been a great experience for me."
194	0	I’ve loved it.
195	0	I’ve always loved business.
196	0	"I’ve always been good at building things, and I’ve always been successful at making money."
197	0	"I’d buy things that would fail –that would be failures — and I’d turn them around and try and get them for the right price, and then I’d turn them around and make them successful."
198	0	And I’ve been good at it.
199	0	And that takes a certain ability.
200	0	"And, you know, historically, I guess, there’s never really been a businessman or businessperson elected President."
201	0	It’s always been a general or a politician.
202	0	"Throughout history, it’s always been a general — you had to be a general — but mostly it was politicians."
203	0	You never have a businessman.
204	1	"And then, in all fairness, I was saying to Klaus last night: Had the opposing party to me won — some of whom you backed, some of the people in the room — instead of being up almost 50 percent — the stock market is up since my election almost 50 percent — rather than that, I believe the stock market from that level, the initial level, would have been down close to 50 percent."
205	0	That’s where we were heading.
206	0	I really believe that — because they were going to put on massive new regulations.
207	0	You couldn’t breathe.
208	0	It was choking our country to death.
209	0	"And I was able to see that, Klaus, as a businessperson."
210	0	"The other thing is, I’ve always seemed to get, for whatever reason, a disproportionate amount of press or media."
211	0	(LAUGHTER)
212	0	Throughout my whole life — somebody will explain someday why — but I’ve always gotten a lot.
213	0	(LAUGHTER)
214	0	And as businessman I was always treated really well by the press.
215	0	"The numbers speak and things happen, but I’ve always really had a very good press."
216	0	"And it wasn’t until I became a politician that I realized how nasty, how mean, how vicious, and how fake the press can be."
217	0	As the cameras start going off in the background.
218	0	(LAUGHTER)
219	0	"But overall — I mean, the bottom line — somebody said, well, they couldn’t have been that bad because here we are — we’re President."
220	0	And I think we’re doing a really great job with my team.
221	0	"I have a team of just tremendous people, and I think we’re doing a very special job."
222	0	"And I really believe it was time, and it was time to do that job, because I don’t think the United States would have done very well if it went through four or eight more years of regulation and, really, a very anti-business group of people."
223	0	We have a very pro-business group.
224	0	"We have regulations cut to a level — in the history of our country, Klaus — this was reported recently."
225	0	"In one year we’ve cut more regulations in my administration than any other administration in four, eight, or sixteen years, in the one case."
226	0	"We’ve cut more regulations in one year, and we have a ways to go."
227	0	"I mean, we’re probably 50 percent done."
228	0	And we’re going to have regulation.
229	0	There’s nothing wrong with rules and regulations; you need them.
230	0	"But we’ve cut more than any administration ever in the history of our country, and we still have a ways to go."
231	0	"So I think between that and the tremendous tax cuts, we’ve really done something."
232	0	"And one other thing I said — and I saw it last night with some of the leaders and the businesspeople — I think I’ve been a cheerleader for our country, and everybody representing a company or a country has to be a cheerleader, or no matter what you do, it’s just not going to work."
233	0	And the reason I’m a cheerleader is because it’s easy — because I love our country and I think we’re just doing really well.
234	0	And we look forward to seeing you in America — special place — and where you are is a special place also.
235	0	Thank you all very much.
236	0	I appreciate it.
237	0	(APPLAUSE)
238	0	Thank you.
239	0	"Thank you very much, Mr. President, for being with us."
240	0	"The World Economic Forum community, who is assembled here, will be certainly — and I quote you from the last piece of your remarks — will be certainly among “the hardworking men and women who do their duty each and every day making this world a better place for everyone.”"
241	0	Thank you very much for being with us.
242	0	Thank you.
243	0	Thank you very much everybody.
244	0	Thank you.
245	0	(APPLAUSE)
1	0	My fellow Americans:
2	1	"Tonight, I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border."
3	0	"Every day, Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country."
4	0	"We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country."
5	0	America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation.
6	1	"But all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled, illegal migration."
7	1	It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages.
8	0	Among those hardest hit are African Americans and Hispanic Americans.
9	1	"Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl."
10	0	"Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 percent of which floods across from our southern border."
11	0	More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War.
12	1	"In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings."
13	1	"Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don’t act right now."
14	0	This is a humanitarian crisis — a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul.
15	0	"Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States — a dramatic increase."
16	0	These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.
17	0	One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico.
18	0	"Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system."
19	0	This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border.
20	0	This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end.
21	0	"My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers."
22	0	It’s a tremendous problem.
23	0	Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the Department of Homeland Security.
24	0	These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission and keep America safe.
25	0	"In fact, safer than ever before."
26	0	"The proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband, and many other things."
27	0	"We have requested more agents, immigration judges, and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy."
28	0	Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support.
29	0	"Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home."
30	1	"Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier."
31	1	"At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall."
32	0	This barrier is absolutely critical to border security.
33	0	It’s also what our professionals at the border want and need.
34	0	This is just common sense.
35	0	The border wall would very quickly pay for itself.
36	0	The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year — vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress.
37	1	"The wall will also be paid for, indirectly, by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico."
38	0	"Senator Chuck Schumer — who you will be hearing from later tonight — has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past, along with many other Democrats."
39	0	They changed their mind only after I was elected President.
40	0	Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis.
41	0	And they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation.
42	0	The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security.
43	0	My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation.
44	0	But the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and re-opens the government.
45	0	This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting.
46	0	I have invited Congressional leadership to the White House tomorrow to get this done.
47	0	"Hopefully, we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security."
48	0	Some have suggested a barrier is immoral.
49	0	"Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes?"
50	0	"They don’t build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside."
51	0	The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized.
52	0	"America’s heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien, who just came across the border."
53	0	The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country.
54	0	"Day after day, precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders."
55	0	"In California, an Air Force veteran was raped, murdered, and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history."
56	0	"In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading, and dismembering his neighbor."
57	0	"In Maryland, MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States as unaccompanied minors were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16-year-old girl."
58	0	"Over the last several years, I’ve met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration."
59	0	I’ve held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief-stricken fathers.
60	0	So sad.
61	0	So terrible.
62	0	"I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices, and the sadness gripping their souls."
63	0	How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?
64	0	"To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: Imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken?"
65	0	To every member of Congress: Pass a bill that ends this crisis.
66	0	"To every citizen: Call Congress and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border."
67	0	"This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice."
68	0	This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve.
69	0	"When I took the Oath of Office, I swore to protect our country."
70	0	"And that is what I will always do, so help me God."
71	0	Thank you and goodnight.
